## Sims 4 mod kidnapping is a new kidnapping mod for the sims 4 that allows players to kidnap other sims.

Your Sim can kidnap other teen or adult Sims by clicking on your Sim and select Life Tragedies, then “Kidnap Sim to Cave.” A menu will pop up showing the people in your area you can kidnap. Click on the portrait of your victim, and both parties will warp to the Forgotten Grotto Cave.

In The Sims 2, Sims will only be abducted if they are using the Farstar e3 telescope. If the Special Event Camera is enabled, this will trigger a cutscene. Otherwise, a bluish beam will appear, and the Sim will be pulled upward into the unseen UFO, while attempting to hold on to the telescope.
Some Sims 4 players may find this mod disturbing or unnecessary as people use this game for escapism. However, if you put the tragedies occurrence to very low, the mod stops being a murder-fest. At very low, the Sims 4 becomes more realistic, as bad things can happen at any time.
Torment:Your sim will start abusing the kidnapped sim by cutting their arm, slapping them, burning them with a cigarette, or breaking a bottle on their head. *The animations are not that graphic, I made them a bit sims like because the concept scares me, even in videogames*
I've had one of my sims kidnapped. You have to wait 'til kidnappers contact one of your sims (they're gonna ask for a ransom) and when you're gonna paid for it, the kidnappers gonna send you a location to go find your sim. When you wait for the call of the kidnappers, you can ask for help on internet (through the computer) or even contact the police (but personally i paid the ransom). Sorry for my english, i hope it's clear ^

Alien abduction returns in The Sims 4: Get to Work. An abduction can occur anytime at night (10 pm- 4 am). When an abduction does occur, the Sim will stop whatever they're doing and go to "Investigate Weird Light". The Sim will then be beamed up by a blue light into a UFO and be flown off. The Sim will be returned a couple of hours later with a moodlet pertaining to aliens and abduction.
This mod is elaborate, giving the player not just murder tools but brand new game mechanics as well. With Extreme Violence installed, you have the ability to summon gangs to whatever lot you're hanging out in. Of the two gangs available, I was interested in the Thotties, who are essentially a roving band of young women who seduce and then murder Sims. When three young women in corsets showed up wielding daggers, I figured I had the right Sims. They must be the Thotties.
I've only had one of mine kidnapped once, I had to have her wife take out a loan (simcity loan mod) to pay a ransom to get her back! She met the kidnapper at a secret location and before surrendering the kidnapped wife she stabbed the one paying the ransom, and she (the stabbed wife) then had to rush to the hospital. Amazing storytelling tbh, so much more fun than anything that could happen vanilla game!
