## More aspirations for the sims 4 modding community.

As with so many things in the sims community, modders are always here to save the day and they do an incredible job with sims 4 custom aspirations. They make aspirations we’d never get in game, or ones that EA probably would never even think of allowing you to have the best time when playing the game.

Are you looking for a bit more challenge when completing Aspirations in The Sims 4? Do you want your Sims to stand out more with their fulfilled Aspirations? You’re in luck because there’s a brand new Mod which not only overhauls the existing Aspirations but also adds 25 new ones!
There is nothing better than digging deep into the world of mods in The Sims 4. They seriously change how you can play the game and these sims 4 custom aspirations are going to make playing so much more fun. Aspirations are awesome and when paired with custom traits you can make the absolute best and most interesting sims ever. Happy Playing!
The careers in The Sims 4 base game are nice, but we’ve got to admit that they can be a lot more. And that’s exactly what this mod is all about! Having cool additional active careers is something that has been on the wish list of many Sims fans out there.
But before you use this aspiration, you HAVE to download the whim overhaul mod that’s listed in my ‘mods I can’t live without’ post.Since the sims team up and abandoned the whim system, this mod will update the game with whims for all of the expansion and game packs.

When you play a lot of The Sims 4 you’ll get bored of regular aspirations as they get stale, so downloading sims 4 custom aspirations is the way to go. The base game aspirations are so boring after all these years and we need to be consistently given new ones but even with DLC we are lacking.
Thankfully konansock was able to form this sims 4 custom aspirations mod which has a vast scale when it comes to getting into a particular profession and drastically varied. So with this one, you can be almost anything, be it a detective, surgeon, engineer, etc.
There are already some pre-existing aspirations to play in The Sims 4, but it's pretty easy after playing for a while to get bored of them. Luckily, there are many different aspiration mods to try out. Here is our pick for the top five aspiration mods for The Sims 4.
This mod has reached more than 110,000 downloads at ModTheSims. And if you’re tired of creating Sims with only a handful of traits, this mod is a must-have for you. By randomizing your Sims’ traits and aspirations as they age up, you’ll always have Sims with unique characters. And that’s a big plus in my book.

## Additional aspiration options for players.

With testingcheatsenabled, players can find another aspiration, Power. It was apparently an abandoned thought, because it has no icon and its wants and fears are a combination of Popularity and Fortune aspiration wants and fears. The "Power" aspiration usually involves making friends and gaining promotions. However, this aspiration is not possible to get in any other way, and as such, is defunct. (Furthermore, the aspiration bar cannot be accessed without a reset process).
One thing that many players miss from past games is the ability to have a life time wish instead of an aspiration so this is a must-have if that’s what you want. This is going to allow you to choose an aspiration that has a single goal instead of tiered goals.
Grow Up: All toddlers and children have this aspiration, and it cannot be changed without the use of cheats and/or cheats. Growing up involves learning essential life skills, with toddlers the wants are to learn how to talk, walk, potty trained, nursery rhyme etc.. and/or to be interacted with by family member. And in the case of children, making friends and being successful at school and interacting with family members and learning skills. As soon as children grow up to become teenagers, the player can choose their aspiration.
Sims will have one of eight aspirations at any given time. The base game does not allow a change of aspiration after a Sim is created or becomes a teen. The University expansion pack allows a Sim to change aspiration immediately after finishing their sophomore year. The Nightlife expansion pack added the ReNuYuSenso Orb, an aspiration reward which allows a Sim to change aspiration. In the FreeTime expansion pack, Sims can have a secondary aspiration.
For example, the big happy family aspiration will have you just needing to have six grandchildren instead of all the other steps that are in the base game aspiration traditionally. This allows you to focus on the grand scheme of your sim’s life instead of silly small goals.
Unlocking a reward trait at the end of your Sim’s aspiration is a tiresome procedure, isn’t it? Completing an aspiration has never been easy for me, so I’ve always searched for a mod that allows me to get the reward traits without actually doing the aspirations. And the Aspiration Traits in Rewards Store mod does exactly that.
The Cheap Aspiration Rewards is an extension that answers your questions about reducing the points costs for purchasing all of the Aspiration Rewards. Thanks to Shimrod101 and this mod, you can now get any of the aspirations from the Reward Store much easier!
This aspiration has 4 objectives: Health Enthusiast, Yoga Addict, Well-being Explorer, and Perfectly Balanced. Completing the aspiration will give your Sim an Inner Balance reward trait that unlocks three new interactions: cool down, help to find Zen, and take a breath and cool down.
