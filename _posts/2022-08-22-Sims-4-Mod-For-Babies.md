## Create a custom sims 4 baby with a mod.

Pekesims fixes this issue by introducing the possibility of even more babies with this The Sims 4 pregnancy mod. Be warned, however, that raising this many children is going to be a major challenge, but at the same time, it really does make things a bit more interesting. For extreme family players only!

We can all agree that we don’t have the best versions of babies in TS4. There are far too many things missing to make this a really meaningful experience. Most of the time, caring for babies in Sims 4 is only causing headaches, so mods and custom content are really necessary.
If you don’t download anything else, I highly recommend this as the best baby mod for Sims 4. This mod goes above and beyond another baby cc, in that it really does add realism and gameplay for sims taking care of a baby. As a family player, I like how it makes Sims 4 babies more interactive. Do note that you cannot use this mod with any mod that alters the base game bassinets– but it is base game compatible. I will note that the bulk of this mod is related to being a parent.
For a simple combination of the essentials, the Pregnancy Mega Mod by scumbobo and java7nerd is an ideal pick for those who just want to have a bit more control over their offspring and increase the amount of storytelling that's available. This pregnancy mod for The Sims 4 is a combination of a few different ones and lets the player see how many babies a Sim will have, as well as their genders.
Babies play a big role in Sims 4. They’re the center of every family in the game and you often spend much of your time and energy on them. But what if you can improve your overall experience? Well, that’s totally possible with the best baby mods and CC for Sims 4!

They become a favorite of your family and end up attracting a lot of responsibility, which many players find hard to cope with. So to assist you in completing these tasks, we have laid some of the best sims 4 baby mods to help you enrich your gaming experience.
There's a surprising amount of restrictions when it comes to who can get pregnant in The Sims 4. While biologically it might make some sense, this is a game and players should be able to play out whatever scenarios they want. So, here, in the name of ultimate equality, is a mod that allows just about anyone to impregnate anyone!
Script mods change up to or add to your gameplay. These are great options so long as your computer can handle them. You should download script mods just as you would any custom content for Sims 4– place package files (unzipped) in your Mods folder under your Sims 4 folder.
For those who don’t want a new little devil every time they press the Try for Baby option, here is a gentle solution. This baby mod smooths out the chances of getting pregnant in The Sims 4. It sets the odds somewhere in the middle so you don’t crate babies constantly. And this way, everything feels more natural.

## Create a sims 4 baby with custom dna.

With the research station from Sims 3 University, you can make a clone baby of sims and collect DNA from other sims. With the hospital in Oasis Landing from Sims 3 Into the Future, your sims can go to the future hospital and make a custom baby with two sims' DNA for 5000 simoleons (but the two sims must be present for this to work).
The Sims 4 shows a wide variety of mixed features. The children tend to come out with features ranging from exactly like the one parent to an in-between mix. It appears that there are no recessive genes in The Sims 4 that are passed down. This makes it impossible to inherit a gene from a grandparent or any other ancestor unless one of the parents displays the trait.
Does anyone know if there is a mod where you can bring DNA samples to the future to make genetically engineered babies with? As in, a sim can request DNA from someone, go to the future, and make a child with them without having to travel with them to the future or being in the same household.
Genetics are traits such as hair color, eye color, or skin tone that Sims have, and can pass to their children. In The Sims, genetics did not exist, and a baby that grew into a child received a randomly selected body and head skin. Genetics were officially introduced in The Sims 2. In Create a Sim for The Sims 2, The Sims 3, and The Sims 4, once the player has made one male Sim and one female Sim, they can create a child for the couple that has the genetics of both parents. In The Sims 4, players can also create a genetic child for Sims of the same gender.
To access the breeds list, click the body of the pet, then select the button with the paw print. You can even select two breeds at the bottom of this screen to create a mixed breed based on those settings, similar to rolling a human child based on the DNA of two other Sims. After making the roll, you are free to change the pet however you wish. If you're creating a pet from scratch, you can then click the "Mixed Breed" line above their Pet Traits and rename the breed to whatever you wish.
Sims created in Create a Sim will have homogeneous genes, unless they were created with "Make a Child". Sims generated by the game, such as replacement townies and generated adoptees also have homogeneous genes. Pre-made townies and NPCs may or may not have homogeneous genes, and often have visible characteristics, such as hair color, that is different from their genetics.
OK, so there's no official way to ensure that you get the number of babies you want. There's certainly no easy way to do it, even with cheats. However, if you're really dedicated to the idea of massively numbered offspring, the following sequence can help you to force the outcome:
How custom hair behaves genetically depends on whether or not it has been placed in one of the Maxis color bins. Custom hair that has been properly "binned" as black, brown, blond, or red behaves the same as Maxis hair, though it will still have the custom-content "star" in CAS and change appearance. Like Maxis hair, it may be randomly assigned to a Sim when his or her genetics are determined. Each custom hairstyle that has not been "binned" has its own genetic code. A Sim who inherits a custom-hair gene from a parent of the same gender will receive that style. However, a Sim will not have custom-hair genetics unless he/she inherited them, or was given hair from the Custom bin when created in CAS, as Change Appearance does not change genetics.
