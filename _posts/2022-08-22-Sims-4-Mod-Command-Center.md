A while ago an article was posted here about ModTheSims user Deaderpool’s Sims 4 script mod, the MC Command Centre, much like Twallan’s Master Controller mod for The Sims 3. Features include story progression, and so much more! Deaderpool updates his mod frequently, adding new options to change your game. In-game, this can be accessed by your Sims’ computer, as well as by clicking a Sim, with an extra menu bubble to indicate the Command Centre. The mod comes with many add-ons so that you can mix and match the effects you want in your game.
The Sims 4 has a pretty elaborate population control system. It generates NPCs randomly at certain intervals, without going over the limit of Sims that the player has determined for their version of the game. It's always good to double check the limit in the game menu, as it can affect performance.
The mod also allows to tackle each of these interactions individually, letting the player choose which interactions they'd like to keep and which ones they're better off without. No more having to watch Sims go and play Blicblock for the millionth time on the same day!
Its compatibility is tested and proven to work with various The Sims 4 game versions such as GTW, OR, Get Together, Dine Out, City Life, Vampires, Parenthood, Cats & Dogs, Jungle Adventures, Seasons, Get Famous, Strangeville, Island Living, Realm of Magic and University Living. However, earlier versions of The Sims 4 are not supported by this mod utility. The installation of this program is a piece-of-cake, especially for those who have prior experience in installing a Sims mod.

Those commands that you may have added from other custom mods won’t appear. But it’s perfect for those times when your Sim is making great conversation and some NPC chump is giving them trouble. Just take the reins for a second, and show them how to behave like a civilized person. Crisis averted.
The Sims 4 community is great at adding their own spice to the game, including wacky mods. While MC Command Center can add to outrageous gameplay, it is also handy for giving practical augmentations to your game. For example, don't you sometimes wish your neighbors would have their own life progressions, such as marriages and children? MC Command Center can help with that.
The MC Command Center is the main mod; it’s necessary for the other MC mods to run, but there’s fun among the function! With it, you can adjust the in-game clock to run at varying speeds, including our time. (Imagine if eating a bowl of cereal didn’t take two hours!) You can also adjust the number of days Sims spend in each life stage, altering their lifespan.
Handles romantic interactions between Sims, and can enable things such as nudity, teen woohoo and risky woohoo. Due to the nature of this module, it is 18+ only. It can be found on a different website by the same user, but the link to it can be found on the MC Command Centre page.

## The sims 4 mod command center is a tool that allows you to manage sims 3 and sims 4 mods.

One among these popular mods for Sims 4 is the Master Controller Command Center or MC Command Center created by a user named Deaderpool. However, the question in people’s minds is “What does MC Command Center do?” It comes with multiple modules which tackle various functionalities inside the game. This includes pregnancies, household bills, as well as the creation of story progression mechanics.
The MC Command Center or MCCC (sometimes referred to as MCMM) is easily one of the most popular mods for Sims 4. Not only do most simmers own this mod, but nearly all players find the game unplayable without it. But, why is this the case? Why is the MCCC such an important mod for Sims 4?
MC Command Center Mod is a perfect mishmash of choices that cater the users with several reasons to get the game and experience customized creativity. The creator of this mod introduced this tool for expansion of the functionality like Sims 4 story progression mod. The mod houses a plethora of functions which include:
Deaderpool's MC Command Center mod is one of the biggest mods for The Sims 4. It gives you control of almost everything in the game, and adds tons of new features, like story progression.

If you are a huge fan or even just a casual player of The Sime 4, MC Command Center mod utility program is a must-try. It is a notable module that everyone shouldn’t miss out on. You will see a fresh and new take on The Sims game as it provides more common-line options, which makes it more enjoyable and engaging top play.
MC Command Center is an expansive mod for Electronic Arts’ Sims 4 that allows you to take control over even the smallest part of the world you have created. Created by Deaderpool as a freemium product, the mega-mod also reintroduces story progression, something from Sims 3.
MC Command Center is a game utility developed by Deaderpool for fans and casual players of The Sims 4. This useful app works just like Twallan’s Master Controller mod for The Sims 3. It’s the main module that’s needed for other modules to work. All modules deployed should match the version of this. Also, it contains several settings and command-line actions. All of these can be accessed your in-game Sims’ computer and by clicking a particular Sim. On top of that, this game mod updates frequently so, you can expect to experience new options that will alter your game from time-to-time.
Now, make sure that the packages and modules are inside the same folder. Also, this particular folder shouldn’t go deeper than one level in Sims 4 folder. For example, a folder “The Sims 4\Mods\MCCC” is perfectly fine. However, a folder “The Sims 4\Mods\Script Mods\MCCC”’ isn’t right. The game Sims 4 shall only penetrate one-level deep while it’s searching for the scripts in the mods.
