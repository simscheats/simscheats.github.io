## Sims 4 mod vie de couple allows players to control the relationship between two sims in an intimate setting.

The Gender Preference mod lets you change the preferences Sims have for romantic partners of particular genders (in The Sims 4 currently that’s just two, female and male). You can adjust the numbers to set your Sims to prefer one gender to the exclusion of the other, to prefer one but also like the other, or to like both equally. Romance away.

This Sims 4 mod is all about adding more complexity to character romance and interactions, letting you tweak the traits they find attractice in others, dating preferences, and even attitude towards birth control. Wonderful Whims adds a whole extra layer to the Sims 4 dating experience, giving it a little extra depth and less superficiality.
Many of the best Sims 4 mods affect the ways Sims interact with each other. The Sims 4 has a long list of traits that change the way a Sim behaves, and because they’re relatively easy for modders to create you can quickly expand that list through custom content.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
This mod by LittleMsSam adds extra options for your romantically-inclined Sims. Using their phone, Sims can plan a date with another Sim at a particular neighborhood location. You can also choose to have one-night-stands and get calls for hook-ups from other NPC Sims. The main mod is pretty unrestricted in who it considers to be eligible for dates, including those in different age categories than your Sim and Sims already in relationships. To fine-tune your dating experience, check out the handful of optional addons available with the SimDa app.
