Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you‚Äôre browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
That's the basics on how to install mods and custom content for The Sims 4, as well as how to troubleshoot, uninstall and keep your Mods folder organised! Got any questions or suggestions that I haven't covered above? Feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to help!
While the game has a ton of content for players, there are some players that still like to get a little more out of their game. Luckily, the Sims community is full of talented people that create custom hairstyles, clothing, furniture, and even gameplay tweaks. Some of these are just for cosmetic purposes, some add silly fun, and some make your game even more realistic.
There's a mod called Wicked Whims that is pretty adult-themed but has a fair share of great tweaks that makes each sim in The Sims 4 all the more believable. Players who just want the family-friendly content present in this game should check out Wonderful Whims instead.

## Create new sims 4 worlds.

All right, adding a custom worlds mod in Sims 4 is fairly easy. Creating one requires a lot of work, but not all people are suited for it. We recommend you to take a look at our personal choices, but also to scour the internet. If you find a save file with wonderful world edit that you like, then that‚Äôs what you add to your Sims 4. Good luck!
What is interesting here is that these are all fanmade worlds that many Sims 4 players create. And because of that, you can find so many unique worlds, some of which you‚Äôve never even dreamed of! The internet is full of such creations and you can find the ideal one for yourself. And if you want to check our favorite selection of Sims 4 custom worlds, check the mods in the list below!
Though the Sims 4 has slowly been introducing new worlds with DLC, fans have been lacking world customisation and variety since the game was released. The Sims 3 had the amazing create-a-world tool, which allowed players to create their own Sims 3 worlds from scratch. Even The Sims 2 had the ability to create custom neighborhoods. Sims 4 is seriously lacking any such feature, and chances of ever getting one is pretty slim.
While previous versions of The Sims have allowed you to create your own, custom worlds ‚Äì whether through developer-provided tools or imports out of SimCity ‚Äì Sims 4 players have had to await new DLC to bring new worlds to the game. But the option to create custom worlds is finally on the way, brought to us by modders.
The reason why the idea of custom worlds rivals even the best mod or CC pack is that it opens new opportunities in Sims 4. Just imagine an empty world where you can start everything from scratch! Or even better, imagine a world that‚Äôs already built especially for you, where everything is pretty and organized, and simply feels right. If that sounds tempting, then you, my friend, must take this journey with us and find the best custom worlds mod for The Sims 4!
In The Sims 4, we have the total freedom to be ourselves. But what if we can‚Äôt truly be ourselves in one of the base-game worlds? What if our soul belongs somewhere else? Well, if that‚Äôs the case with you, then you aren‚Äôt completely out of luck! It‚Äôs totally possible to access custom worlds and load them like any other mod in The Sims 4.
And if you‚Äôre still wondering ‚ÄúHow do I add custom worlds to my Sims 4?‚Äù, then be at ease. Custom worlds are custom content, or CC for short. This means that once you download them, you only need to paste them into your Sims 4 file destination. The process is the same for any other mod or CC, so if you‚Äôre having trouble figuring that out, check our in-depth guide!
After a long two years of development, TwistedMexi has officially announced his Sims 4 Create-a-World Mod! This mod will allow you to edit and change different parts of your world to make for better gameplay and unique environments. The Alpha release of this mod is coming on October 21st, 2021! Check out the official trailer below, and be sure to head over to TwistedMexi‚Äôs Patreon for updates!
