## A sims 4 mod that allows players to move their baby around the house.

The Pregnancy Mega Mod allows you to take full control over your sims pregnancy. It gives you the ability to terminate the pregnancy, select the gender of the baby, and select the number of babies. This is a fun mod for users who like to be in complete control of their own game.

The Shorter/Longer Pregnancy mod is pretty self-explanatory. It allows the user to lengthen or quickly end their sims pregnancy. Overall, this is a good mod if you need a bit more time to get the nursery/child’s room ready, or if you want your sim to be able to go back to being normal you can “force” them to give birth.
Babies play a big role in Sims 4. They’re the center of every family in the game and you often spend much of your time and energy on them. But what if you can improve your overall experience? Well, that’s totally possible with the best baby mods and CC for Sims 4!
We can all agree that we don’t have the best versions of babies in TS4. There are far too many things missing to make this a really meaningful experience. Most of the time, caring for babies in Sims 4 is only causing headaches, so mods and custom content are really necessary.
This mod will give you lots of new things to do together with your baby. Now you can read a bedtime story to your baby, sing a lullaby or play outside – whatever is your wish, this extension has it! It’s filled with new baby interactions that are realistic and fun.

Scumbumbo has also made some amazing changes to how we raise our babies in Sims 4. With this mod, your adult Sims will definitely spend a lot more time with the baby, making intelligent decisions about how to calm it, when to feed it, and everything else in between.
The Baby and Crib Mod, by Kiolometro, allows your newborn baby to be more of... well, a baby... it no longer is attached to the default bassinet/crib when born and becomes a separate object and can be placed in a different location (CC crib/bed/any surface). You can now have more options to customize your baby’s nursery! Note that, the baby will always return to where you place the mod, unfortunately, the baby is still not portable to walk around with like the sims 3.
Sometimes, the older brothers and sisters need to step up and take care of their younger siblings. With this mod, when the parents are too busy, your teen Sims can teach your children what to do and how to do it. This includes everything from homework to manners.
