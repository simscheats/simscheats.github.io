## Sims 4 mod zoo is a website that allows users to download and share mods for the sims 4 game.

The Sims has been out for several years, which means several expansion packs are available for players to purchase. Planet Zoo, on the other hand, was just released so there are no expansions to date for this game. The expansion packs are great as they give you new worlds to explore, different objectives, and home decor.

Planet Zoo gives players complete architectural control as they can move pieces in every direction and create amazing structures and habitats for their guests and animals. The Sims also gives you this freedom, but it is not as extensive in the creative aspect.
Recently, I grabbed Planet Zoo while it was 55% off on Steam and have been obsessed with it ever since. I seriously can’t stop playing this game. It’s a problem. What’s a Simmer to do when they need to come up with new content but can’t stop playing a different game? Mash the two interests together, of course! Coming up with ways to incorporate all my other interests into The Sims is one of my favourite things to do so I decided to build my own zoo in The Sims 4!
If you’d like to download my zoo, search for Palm Conservation Centre (use the Canadian spelling for the word ‘centre’) in the Gallery. My ID is SnarkyWitch. Make sure you filter for CC or the lot will not show up. I did not use any CC at all but the Gallery decided to block my lot with a giant palm leaf covering everything in the preview image, so I had to manually change the preview pic which flags the lot as modded.
Planet Zoo and The Sims are both real-life simulation games that gamers love to play. They allow you to create and encounter real-world situations like managing a budget and keeping humans or animals alive. There are so many ways to compare them, but there are some key aspects to both games that make them better than the other.

The goal in Planet Zoo is to be successful, while the lines in The Sims can be blurred as you decide not to differentiate between right and wrong. Planet Zoo makes sure you focus on animal welfare and guest happiness, and it is impossible for players not to learn something about these creatures while playing the game.
The Sims allows you to create a new you that can be the complete opposite of who you are in real-life. It allows you to add new tattoos, take on a different career, or even start several families. The sky is the limit when it comes to this game as you become something else entirely from who you are in real life.
Deaderpool’s MCCC mod. This will allow you to flag your zookeeper and pets to never age, so you don’t need to worry about them dying and having to replace them if you’re playing a generational save. It will also allow you to flag the household to never move from that lot, as well as flag the zookeeper to never marry or have kids.
