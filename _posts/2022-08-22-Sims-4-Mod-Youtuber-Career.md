## Create and manage a sim career.

Is your sim obsessed with airplanes and flying? The airline career would be an awesome option for them. This career has two branches, one that will be bringing them to be a pilot at level 10 and one that will have them being the airline CEO by the top of this career.

If your creative sim wants to make some extra simoleons then the freelance careers offer a great option. You can become a freelance writer, painter, artist or programmer and after joining an agency you will then be able to take on specific jobs as and when you want to.
Below you are going to find over 40 downloadable custom careers that you can add to your game to give to your sims. These are all rabbit hole careers so they are going to function similarly to careers like business or athletic that are already in the game.
Now, instead of instantly being employed, your sim will have to go through the same hardships as us humans. There’s a new Job Finding skill, the higher your skill, the better jobs you can apply for. That’s right, you now have to attend job interviews, and do well, to get the job of your dreams.
Our next option is a really fun one, the adventurer career! This isn’t for your regular sims, this is for sims who want to go out and live life and be interesting. There are two career branches where your sim can eventually go toward being an educator or a museum curator.

As your sim is working through this career they are going to be a Switchboard Operator where they are going to be working for §20 per hour. The schedule for this job is Monday to Friday which is awesome for sims who care for others and they will work from 9 am to 5 pm.
One way to earn more is by working in real estate, it is definitely one of the best and sophisticated careers for your Sim character. It’s a mature career choice and a childhood dream of many. If you are playing the vanilla game, then you can definitely not get your Sim to sele properties.
The next career on our list is an animal care career that will have your sim working all sorts of jobs with animals. They’ll go from working as a dolphin trainer, to an alligator re-locator and an animal acting coach so you’ll be working all over the place with different animals.
The next option on our list is the Cosmetology career where your sim will be working on other sims and helping them feel beautiful. One fun thing about this career is that there are 3 branches where you can be a hairstylist, a nail technician or an esthetician.

## Create and manage sim characters.

Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
That's the basics on how to install mods and custom content for The Sims 4, as well as how to troubleshoot, uninstall and keep your Mods folder organised! Got any questions or suggestions that I haven't covered above? Feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to help!
Go to your Mods folder and right-click it. Again, copy it to your Desktop. Once you're sure you have a copy of your Mods folder on your Desktop, go ahead and delete the copy in your Sims 4 folder. Restart your game and play it for a few minutes. If your game runs without crashing or having errors, you know the issue is with one of your Mods. If it doesn't, you'll need to go out and repair your game (and the issue is something within your Sims 4 game itself).
Hi Adrian, thank you for letting me know about that! Sadly a lot of sites have plagiarised my work (I can see they even used my same screenshot of my Sims 4 folder, lol). I'll send them a copyright infringement letter straight away. Thanks for the head's up! :)
To do this, start the game, click on the Menu button (the three buttons on the top right corner), Game Options, Other and then tick the Enable Custom Content and Mods box. Then hit the Apply Changes button and restart your game. The next time you start it up, your settings will be saved and you'll be able to play with mods!
Because Script mods do the most changing in the game, they are the most likely to cause major game play errors if they're broken or out of date. Go back to your Sims 4 folder and take out any script mods (custom careers, WickedWhims, McCommand Centre, etc.) and then test your game without them. If the errors are gone, you know that one of your script mods is broken and needs to be fixed or updated.
Installing custom content and mods in your Sims 4 game can be a bit confusing! From knowing where to place the items, to figuring out what to do when your CC doesn't work: there's a lot to know, and it can be tricky, especially if you're a beginner. This guide will teach you all you need to know about downloading, installing, and troubleshooting custom content and mods for TheSims 4!
