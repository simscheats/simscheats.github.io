In the case of polygamy, the partners know about each other’s romantic interactions.

Maybe your Sims live in an elaborate society where the rules are different than the Western world, or you're just tired of being limited to two Sims per marriage. The Sims 2 doesn't natively support polygamy, but a cheated wedding arch exists that can be used to create polygamous marriages! This wikiHow will teach you how to have more than one spouse on The Sims 2.
In the normal gaming mode, you are limited to pursuing a particular type of relationship with a specific Sims character or characters per se. For instance, when one Sims character is related to another; they cannot romance each other lest involve in matrimony. The Sims 4 polygamy mod was introduced to intrigue the users with something more than the plain old ways accepted in everyday life.
Under generic circumstances, the sims characters can pursue only a certain relationship type with a limited number of people. There are several rules that come into play when using the Sims 4 Polygamy mod including the idea of non exclusive relationships (the bases of poly relationships), here are some examples:
– Want you Sims to be polyamorous? Make sure their preference is towards non-exclusive relationships! If not, change it in the Actions menu. They’ll then both be happy with the multiple partner aspect. Remember that the game by default allows having several boyfriends/girlfriends/SOs, so your Sims can ask several others to by Significant Others, and if they’re in a Non-Exclusive relationship everyone will be non-jealous.

## Polygamy in video games has been controversial for years.

To be fair, this mod was created to support same-gender couples having children by natural means in the game (i.e., two guys or two girls can have children each other). So I suppose as long as intentions are good and progressive, the modding community has nothing to worry about.
The real problem here is not if there is heterosexual/homosexual relationships within a game but that to many game developers that need to lay of the porn. The whole cover of “it’s realism” is such a crock. To many games these days are over sexualized and really take away from the game’s story rather than add to it. What is sad is that we are more interested in having sex/relationships in a game rather than having a well told, and well written story.
If these video games are going for accurate life portrayal, then by all means former partners should be upset when they see you with another. Sure, its just a game, but taking out the negative aspects of sleeping around reinforce a cultural norm that I believe is destructive. I understand that these games seek entertainment value, so that has to be factored in as well.
I played Sims as a kid and I think that it was part of the reason I was so open to same-sex relationships as a child. Of course I wouldn’t see a couple and think, “this is like The Sims” but it made it normal for me and very easy to accept. So this video game helped give me this way of thinking for a child, I think more casual representation is needed in all forms of media.
Fascinating article. An avid Sim-er myself, I never really looked into the larger LGBT ramifications of the game before. But the vicarious nature of simulated life is certainly something I can relate to. And I agree that this simulation does serve as a safe space for those in question.
Having always played The Sims from the very first game on PC I never felt that it was any sort of political statement, it was more just a part of the game. Every good creator leaves their creation up for the interpretation of others, and as a life simulation it only makes sense that Maxis never posed restrictions on sexuality.
Under normal circumstances, you can only pursue certain types of relationships with certain people. If a sim is related to another sim, they can’t romance each other — and they definitely can’t marry each other, for example. Another rule: teens can’t become pregnant. But just because the game is designed a certain way doesn’t mean players don’t want to toy with certain simulations anyway, regardless of how socially acceptable they’d be in real life.
I’m pretty sure the whole thing started from a mistake. apparently when they were going to showcase the game at a festival before it was launched they took the old version with them, not the version in which they already had decided to delete same sex attraction. because there was a scene in the promo video of two men kissing, unintentionally there (?) a lot of talk happened around the game really early. might be a reason for its success straight from the beginning. this is just a story I heard 🙂
