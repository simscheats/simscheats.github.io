## The sims 4 mod extreme violence update adds new horrific violence to the game.

Have you ever tried modding a Sims 4 game to have a gaggle of female sims in Victorian ball gowns stab other ball goers to death? I have and I don’t recommend it. The amount of clipping and whatever else happened to my poor integrated graphics was too much for the game to bear. It crashed and forced me to redownload all 40 gigabytes of the game.

To install the Extreme Violence Mod, players must first create a mod folder under the Electronic Arts file on their computer. This is the main file that houses all of the Sims information. If a player has already installed mods for the Sims 4, then this folder should already exist. Once the folder is created, download the Extreme Violence Mod directly from Sacrificial Mods. Players may need to unzip the file before it is usable unless the downloaded version is a script mod. It's important to note that these files must not be in a subfolder otherwise the mod will not work.
The mod also adds gangs that engage in turf wars in different neighborhoods. Players get the option to join one of two gangs, i.e., The Thotties or the HardWood gang. Subsequently, the mod also changes Police behavior in Sim 4. The police have been tweaked to deal appropriately with players who go on a murderous rampage.
Letting a character in The Sims 4live a long, happy life is all well and good, but sometimes what players really want is to cause utter chaos within the game, and luckily, there are a slew of mods created just for that purpose. The practice of torturing and killing Sims has gone on before Sims 4, but without the use of mods it can sometimes be difficult for players to make their Sims miserable. Although some deaths can be triggered purposefully without much trouble, like starvation or drowning, many are random events controlled by the game. The options for physical altercations between Sims is also lacking without mods, making it difficult to start any sort of drama between Sims.
The mod can also utilize the fame system from the Sims 4: Get Famous Expansion Pack, giving players the chance to become a celebrity for their evil deeds. However, these actions are not free of consequences. Other Sims may fight back and even kill the initial offender, and Sims that are repeatedly violent will earn a negative reputation and can even be arrested, although there is an option in The Sims 4 to turn off both law enforcement and the reputation system.

After the file is downloaded, launch the Sims 4 game, click on the Game Options menu, and select Other. Check off the Enable Mods and Custom Content box or, if it is a script mod, then check the Enable Script Mods box. Once that is done, all that is left to do is apply the settings and start playing. For players still having issues accessing the mod, YouTuber Simming Pothead offers a step-by-step tutorial.
The Sims 4 makes it easy for users to install mods. For Windows users, players will want to direct their downloads from the modding site to their Sims 4 Mods folder, which can be found by opening the "Documents" folder under "This PC," then opening the "Electronic Arts" folder followed by the folder for The Sims 4. Here there should be a folder labeled "Mods" - if not, players can simply create their own by right-clicking and creating a new folder. To use and install Sims 4 mods on Mac the process is almost identical, except the "Documents" folder will be found after opening the "Users" folder and selecting themselves. Players should then extract any compressed files within the folder, and be certain that no files are located more than one folder deep within the Mods folder, as the game will not be able to find these files. In order to make sure all downloaded mods will work within The Sims 4, players will need to enable mods and script mods in the game's "Options" menu.
Since the release of The Sims in the year 2000, mods and cheats have been a huge part of players’ experience. From changing simple things like hair color, make-up styles, and clothing to adding new furniture, stories, and careers for your Sims to enjoy – mods are true game-changers.
Sometimes when a killer is killing a sim while another sim is trying to interact with the killer, the sim who is trying to interact would die instead of the targeted sim.- I'm really sorry about this I still couldn't figure out what's causing this yet and I'm still trying to fix it.

## The sims 4 mod extreme violence update adds new terrifying violence to the game.

One of such mods is the Extreme Violence mod, which adds a hefty dose of real-world realism and horror slasher themes into any happy-go-lucky Sims neighborhood. It's a pretty big mod to download, so it's important that players know how to download the Extreme Violence mod in Sims 4 to avoid the game from breaking.
The Sims 4 Extreme Violence mod adds a plethora of unsightly delights to the game. Famed for the numerous ways of murdering fellow Sims, the mod lets you live out your criminal wants and needs. The added murders range from running over Sims with a car, mowing down civilians with an Uzi, literally ripping out a Sims heart, and many, many more!
The Sims 4Extreme Violence Mod adds a brutal new feature to the classic life simulation game. As the most recent console release in the franchise, Sims 4 allows players to create characters and live out their own stories. While the basic game is filled with new content Despite the dozens of DLC expansions packs available in The Sims, many players turn to fan-made mods to get a custom experience.
The Extreme Violence Mod gives Sims 4 players the power to dispatch other sims via various means, including running them over with a car or tearing out their hearts. Homicide is not the only thing introduced in Extreme Violence. Players can also lead a life of crime as a robber or even smack other sims. Conversely, sims also have the ability to defend themselves thanks to the mod.
To install, simply download the file. Then, extract to a destination: the mods folder of your Sims 4 program files (or cut and paste the extracted files). Make sure not to put the files inside a subfolder, as this will not let it work. Finally, allow ‘mods’ and ‘script mods’ in the game options menu. There you have it – the Extreme Violence mod is installed and ready to go!
The Extreme Violence mod also adds other new mechanics that makes the game more interesting to play. For example, players can murder as many Sims as they want until the grim reaper beats the player up. Players can also clean up evidence after committing a murder, such as washing blood off or hiding bruises.
The Extreme Violence mod is one of the most famous mod packs from Sacrificial Mods, a major mod creator in The Sims 4 community. They're best known for their mind-blowingly detailed and immersive mods that deal with zombie apocalypses, a fame system prior to Get Famous coming out, and various other large mods worth discovering.
Extreme Violence deals with exactly what it promises: violence. Players should expect gruesome animations, new interactions, and loads of blood. Sims can now murder one another in various ways, engage in illegal activities and even deal with the police.
