Like many PC games, the Sims 4 has a large modding community. While some mods offer primarily cosmetic changes to the game in the form of furniture or character customizations, other Sims 4 mods add new places to explore or new ways to interact with other sims. The best part is that mods like the Extreme Violence Mod are available for free.
Many of the best Sims 4 mods affect the ways Sims interact with each other. The Sims 4 has a long list of traits that change the way a Sim behaves, and because they’re relatively easy for modders to create you can quickly expand that list through custom content.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience. Although the game is fun enough on its own (there's plenty of stuff you can do in The Sims 4 already), it gets even better when you're able to have more meaningful conversations, or fix the lag that's been bothering you. We selected some of the handiest, most entertaining, and most beautiful Sims 4 mods out there. Check the list to see which ones you like best, and you can install them right away!

Since sims 4 mods aren’t created by or maintained by EA there is always a chance that something in a mod can conflict with the way the game operates, especially since The Sims 4 is consistently updated. You want to find sims 4 mods that are consistently updated too because mods can break often, and can break your game if they aren’t updated.
Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
The success of the game is driven by a thriving and lively bunch of modders who are responsible for creating tons of weird and wonderful additions to the game. If you’re looking for some excellent mods that will enhance your Sims 4 gaming experience, here are some great options you should consider.
This Sims 4 mod is all about adding more complexity to character romance and interactions, letting you tweak the traits they find attractice in others, dating preferences, and even attitude towards birth control. Wonderful Whims adds a whole extra layer to the Sims 4 dating experience, giving it a little extra depth and less superficiality.

## Mods allow for a level of customization that is unrivaled in any other game.

Sometimes, a mod doesn't have to be complicated to make a big difference to your game. By simply adding two new traits to the game, this mod from Vitorpiresa grants the player access to a brace of important abilities that many would find... unnatural.
This next mod isn’t going to be the most realistic mod for the game, but it will add some wild experiences to your game by allowing any toddlers to become killers. Having this mod is definitely not for the family game player but it can be really fun to mix up gameplay with mods like this once in a while.
Once you're in game, you'll also need to enable mods in your game settings by going to your Options menu under the Other tab. Make sure to check off "Enable Custom Content and Mods" and "Script Mods Allowed" depending on what you've chosen to install. You'll need to restart your game afterwards.
There is so much to do with this mod, and a ton of other mods have add-on features included that work with MC Command Center. Downloading this gives you another level of control in the game, and adds as much if not more to the game than an expansion pack. It’s the biggest mod I’ve ever seen, the most detailed one, and one that I use every single time I play the Sims. Have fun disabling the monster under the bed and generating a town with only toddlers. Hooray for customization!
This mod allows you to use almost all the cheats for the game simply by clicking. You’ll only need to select the cheat you want and that’s it. No typing and no enabling cheats whatsoever! It’s a quality of life change that I recommend to everyone out there!
You can have wings of different colors, can cast magic auras, meditate, "fly", and more! Nyx worked really hard on this mod and it shows- there's tons of buffs, new interactions, abilities and fun elements which makes it feel like an exciting addition to the game.
This mod upgrades every aspect of the education system. Your child and teen sims can learn from the computer, you can enroll your students in private school, you can build skills and meet friends while at school, and you can even send your toddlers to preschool! If you like to play families, this is the mod for you.
Answer: Tons! You can check on the individual mod's page to see if it's base-game only or if it requires expansion packs. A lot of the custom traits are base game compatible, for example. When I used to make mods, all of mine were base game compatible too :)
