## Mod wedding pack is a sims 4 mod that allows you to get married in-game.

The Rustic Romance Stuff pack is a fan-created stuff pack by little cakes and zx-ta at Plumbob Tea Society that is completely free for Sims 4. The stuff pack includes over 50 items, 30 of those items are just for create-a-sim alone and include dresses, tuxes, bridesmaid outfits, flower girl, and ring bearer outfits for kids of all ages. The other items are generally for lighting, comfort, and decoration. There is even a bar and banquet table included. Lastly, the pack includes five different poses that work with the pose player. This is the only wedding-specific pack I have found and it’s a must-have for in-game custom content.

The My Wedding Mod is one of the best sims 4 mods for creating more in-depth, fun, and realistic weddings. Definitely check out this mod for yourself and please head over to Caradriel’s Patreon and join if you can. We need to support our precious sims 4 mod and cc creators!
Weddings are such a drag because of how broken the pack is. Sims aren’t sitting like they’re supposed to or fans of a famous Sim will crash the party. The dresses that are included in the game aren’t the best but they’re a nice start. In this list we’re going to show you some of our favorite custom content and mods to help create a beautiful wedding on Sims 4.
After a teaser in January suggested a wedding game pack was on the way for the Sims 4, we now have a whole lot more detail on what to expect. It’s just not official yet. A new game pack called My Wedding Stories has leaked complete with a host of screenshots, a cover image, and a release date, so these early details are already looking pretty solid.
Weddings are a fun goal event in Sims 4 that can be used to gain rewards and tell a story. Custom content helps weddings be more personal and interesting by either changing how certain game mechanics work or by adding objects and clothing to match aesthetics. This list is just a small glimpse at some of the best wedding-specific custom content out there. Whether you are looking for a unique venue, a pretty dress, or a cool wedding arch you will find something that fits your taste and aesthetic.

Weddings are supposed to be a joyous occasion where your Sims friends and family can be part of the experience. With the wedding pack you can ask friends to be flower girls, ring bearer, best man, & you can even ask your parents or siblings for their blessing to marry. You can travel to the wedding world of Tartosa to taste test cakes & order flowers. After you’ve done some of these activities you can now throw events that lead up to getting married.
The Sims 4 Wedding Stories overhauls the wedding system, allowing you to take full control of your special day. Introducing new events and activities, it replaces the existing wedding system with a more fleshed out alternative. You'll need to use the new calendar feature to plan your day and there's also preparation work to do.
One of my favorite parts about My Wedding Stories is the crowd control options. Anyone who's played The Sims knows the frustrations of trying to corral party guests. Creating a group helps, but the new pack offers helpful commands for guests to take their seats for the ceremony, walk down the aisle, gather for the bouquet toss, throw rice, eat and drink. There's also a new slow dance option so your newlyweds can have a proper first dance.
In true Sims fashion, this pack embraces diversity with wedding options. Instead of a one-size-fits-all event, My Wedding Stories says it'll have options to host traditional Chinese weddings with customary tea ceremonies with family, for example. The pack also includes red dresses worn in Hindu ceremonies, as well as the option to include henna tattoos. Wedding clothes include stylish pantsuits if your Sim isn't a fan of dresses. It's refreshing to see gender-neutral versions of wedding roles and events.

## Mod wedding pack is available as a free download from the sims 4 official website.

The free update to accompany the upcoming The Sims 4 My Wedding Stories game pack is now live. While you need to get the DLC to experience most of the new content (new world, marriage planning), base game players are also treated to some new stuff available with the free update.
The Sims 4's newest game pack, My Wedding Stories, is now available for PC and Mac via Origin and Steam, PS5, PS4 and Xbox consoles.

This looks super cool and I’ll definitely download it when I re-download The Sims 4. My only complaint is that I was disappointed to find out that you seemingly can’t have a wedding party I just thought it would be fun to have instructions like ask to be bridesmaid_groomsman( or maybe just a gender-neutral asked to be in wedding party to simplify things) and throw the bachelor/bachelorette parties. I also think it could be super cute to have flower girls and ring bearers
The Sims Resource is where I get 90% of my custom content and I even pay every month for their VIP subscription. The site is easy to use, well thought out and has categories and tabs for finding specific pieces of custom content. They even have a section dedicated to weddings, where you’ll find a large number of dresses, accessories, and venues to download.
Weddings in Sims 4 can be a bit buggy and caterers aren’t really the best at their job. I personally skip catering and just use buffet tables for my Sims weddings which can be found in the build/buy mode. A minimum of two guests needs to be invited with a maximum of 15.
Mod The Sims has been around since the early days of the Sims franchise and holds a variety of custom content for Sims 2,3 and 4. While it doesn’t get the same amount of use as other sites it’s a valuable resource for game mods and other basic custom content. It’s also home to a few creators that make absolutely wonderful game mods that will enhance your gameplay, such as, Turbodriver and scumbumbo.
