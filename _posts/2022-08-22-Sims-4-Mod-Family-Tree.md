## Create a family tree for your sims 4 mods.

I’m going to teach you how to use a really easy and intuitive family tree tool called The Plum Tree App to document your Sims’ family trees. The best part of this tool is that it’s designed for The Sims, so it’s much easier to use than a genealogy website designed for real people.

To use the mod, click on the desired sim and click on the Set Family Relationships Menu. Here, you can add or remove relationships (parents are not included because I couldn’t get the family tree to update the way MCC grandparents and siblings worked). For example, if you click on a sim, you can make them your active sim’s grandparent by clicking “Set as Grandparent”.
One thing that’s very odd about The Sims 4 is the fact that family members start disappearing after a while. As you grow your family and play with the same one further on, older Sims simply get deleted from your family tree. The game cuts them off as not important, but that’s very wrong, in our opinion. Fortunately for us, there is a working family tree mod that helps us with this issue!
When thinking back to the start of The Sims 4, I still can’t believe we didn’t have family trees at launch. Even when added to the game they are less than ideal and a lot of your sim’s extended family will just disappear and turn to grey outlines that don’t even have their faces, so annoying.
This is a mod for The Sims 4 that adds 70+ cheats to the game, such as editing family trees, adopting pets and other Sims into family trees, recognition of extended family members, adjusting Sim info such as adding diplomas to Sims, changing weather events, directly switching between households without going to world management, shortcuts for build and CAS cheats, and so much more. Everything in this mod is very useful for setting up your Sims, families, save files, gameplay, etc.

Now, with this feature, you’ll be able to look at your Sim’s family history, including brothers and sisters, mothers, fathers, grandparents (and some greats, and great greats, etc.), step relationships (like Step-Parent), half relationships (like Half-Sibling), and of course, Spouses.
The No Culling Mod (again, by the talented Neia) does exactly what it says, and it's essential for anyone who wants to keep their family trees intact and play with all the Sims they've created or befriended. You can easily do your own culling by periodically going through the neighborhood menu and deleting Sims manually (and you can keep an eye on your population by downloading this small Get Town Population mod). This is a must-have for any player, in my opinion!
Set Node Parents. This is where you can assign parents to your Sims. In most cases, you can already see a Sim’s parents by looking at the tree, but this section becomes important when your Sims have children with multiple partners, or when a Sim is adopted by a relative and it’s not immediately apparent by looking at the tree who is a child of whom. I’ll go over this in more detail later, but for now, make sure you are always assigning parents here and indicate whether they are biological or adoptive parents.
Once you have your account set up, you will be able to start creating family trees. In the same section where you created your account, select Create Tree. As you can see in the screenshot below, I have many family trees already saved on my account, but we are going to start a new one for this tutorial so you can see how it all comes together.

## Create an event for your sims 4 mods.

Have you ever wanted to play The Sims 4 as a multiplayer game with your friends? Well, there’s a whole mod that lets you host a multiplayer game for up to twelve players and you’ll be able to see everything the other person is doing in your save file.
The Sims 4 makes it easier than ever: simply download the mod in question, unzip the files (they will typically end in .package), and then drag and drop them into the "Mods" folder, which is already located in your Sims files (navigate to Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4Mods to locate).
After the patch for The Sims 4: Seasons there were tons of really great cheats totally removed from the game, making it impossible for us to use them. Thankfully, Twisted Mexi (patreon) created a mod where you can turn these cheats back on. There is even an entire list of cheats so you know which ones you can use!
There are a number of questions we get every single time we write an article about sims 4 mods and pieces of custom content. It makes sense because there are so many questions and uncertainties when it comes to mods but we’re here to make those make sense!
The reality show mod by Kawaii Stacie (Patreon) allows you to enroll your sim in a reality show that will last 3 sim days. This mod requires The Sims 4: Get Famous and will have your sims gaining fame while they are working this reality TV gig, its a silly mod but extremely fun.
Something that I’m always hoping is for the team to add more simple things for our sims to do. I don’t even mind if all of the events are rabbit holes, and that’s what this mod adds. It adds so many options for rabbit hole events like going for ice cream, and going shopping with friends.
You should never have to pay for any sims 4 mods ever, this includes custom content too. There are actually rules that come directly from EA that state that you are not allowed to have things behind permanent pay walls and are only allowed to have these items on early access on things like Patreon but you must eventually make these items available for free.
This is one of my MUST HAVE, no matter what, always installed mods in The Sims 4. This mod allows you to click directly on the games UI to execute cheat commands. For example, if you click on a sim’s relationship with their spouse you can change their relationship values to increase or decrease their romance and friendship.
