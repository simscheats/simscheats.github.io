## Creating a sims 4 mod that allows players to place objects anywhere they want.

When it comes to building in The Sims 4, players can be very creative and distinct in their creations. But oftentimes we all find ourselves limited in some details. So, whenever you are struggling to place an object at just the right place, you need to use the MoveObjects Cheat.

The Move Objects cheat allows you to move objects anywhere off the grid. To use Cheats in the Sims 4 hold down Ctrl+Shift+C for windows or Command (⌘)+Shift+C for Mac at the same time and a small bar will appear at the top left hand corner of the screen where you can type.
By using The Sims 4 free build cheat, you can place your building structures wherever you like with having to follow those pesky rules about 'grids' or 'protected zones' that would otherwise restrict where your next house or extension will go. Not only that, but you can also forget about the spatial limits you'd otherwise have to adhere to in The Sims 4, which gives you complete free rein in Build Mode to construct the designs of your dreams. Wave a cheery goodbye to any frustration over conformity, and let your imagination run wild with The Sims 4 free build cheats we've detailed here.
This cheat is a must know for any simmer who wishes to become a good builder and it’s my most used cheat in The Sims 4. The Move Objects cheat has been in the game for decades and lets you place objects in spots that the game would normally not allow.
We suggest using MoveObjectsOn when placing decorations or furniture that your Sims can’t have any interactions with since some furniture might become unusable when placed with MoveObjectsOn. For example, you can place a kitchen stove on the pool, but your Sims will not be able to use it.

The Sims games have evolved their build modes in some interesting ways over the years, but one thing that’s always stayed the same is its grid placement mechanic. Since Sims need ample room to perform animations for each item, the grid mechanic keeps everything in check. It also means, however, that things can look a bit unrealistic at times. Luckily, The Sims 4 has a secret workaround that will allow you to place an item outside these strict boundaries.
When activating the sims 4 move objects cheats, you can also adjust how high something sits. All you have to do is pick up an item and press 9 on your keyboard every time it's pressed; that way, its height will be raised a little bit more with each keystroke.
Building in The Sims 4 can be tricky and time-consuming to really achieve the aesthetic you’re craving. It can also be really expensive. With The Sims 4 free build cheats you’ll be able to unlock your full building potential enabling the chance to not only build on lots you weren’t allowed to before but move objects wherever you want too, disregarding their grid placement. Simply follow the instructions below to get going.
Do you want to decorate your Sims 4 house? If so, there's a feature that will be especially helpful for getting the job done. You can enlarge any object with just one keystroke by using an enlarging function in the game. This is way easier than having to use cheats or something like that!

## Modifying the game files in order to allow objects to be placed anywhere.

Before you enter the move objects cheat, when placing objects if you try and place an object not within the grid the green box that is under the object will turn red and you won’t be able to place the object in that spot. When you enter the move objects cheat you now can place objects wherever you please.
When you find that you can’t place something where you would like or you have an idea to create something truly unique, you might want to break out the most awesome cheat in a builder’s toolbox: MOO. MOO stands for Move Objects On and if you are not familiar with it, it is worth trying. MOO allows you to completely disregard all of the game’s rules of object placement and place objects wherever you want.
By holding the ALT key when you place something, the grid will be ignored and you will be free to place it anywhere. Things moved this way will still have the footprint that says how many squares of floor space is needed. Unless you also use the moveobjects cheat, items cannot share the same space. Combining the moveobjects cheat and holding the ALT key will give more placement options.
While the move objects cheat is activated, we can also adjust the height at which something sits. Pick up the item and press the 9 key, every time you press the key, the item will be raised a little. When it's at the desired height, release it and it will stay at that height. To lower something use the 0 key instead. This is useful for placing things on surfaces that the game would not normally allow.
When moving objects around by default the objects will only move to certain places on the grid. They move in an almost jumpy sort of fashion. There is a way to move the objects smoothly and with the ability to place them on any part of the grid. Follow these steps:
To get even more control over your placement, hit ALT while grabbing an item. This allows complete off grid placement so you can nudge an item into the exact place you want it to be. Want that end table to be closer to a chair? With MOO and pressing ALT, you can get it exactly where you want it. You can put “presents” under the Christmas tree at just the right angle. You will find that some objects on slotted surfaces, such as coffee tables or counters, resist off grid placement with MOO and the alt button. With patience, you can nudge some things into place. Just keep moving the object around on the surface very slowly while holding alt.
You can make movable objects like armor, weapons, junk, e.t.c static (kannot be kicked and don't fall) and back. Default hotkeys - 'Home' turn object physics on (make it movable/droppable if possible), 'End' turn object physics off (make it static if possible).
I upload this cheat for people WHO WANT to put objects in the neighborhood outside the lots like benches and other park items but they cant because EA dont give us editing neighborhood tools. If you dont like it and you are not interesting in it sorry I can't do anything. Have a great day
