If there is a way to break the barrier of the 8 Sims, but remember that the more members you have, the more difficult the game will be, since you have to take care of the needs and objectives of each of them. To make this work you need to use a mod known by the name of "Full House Mod" that can be downloaded from the official website of the creator . Just in case you're wondering, Electronic Arts officially allows mods to be used in The Sims 4, although it clarifies that these are used under the responsibility of the users . However, the Full House Mod has been used by many players and is fully functional while keeping the game's performance in top condition.
This Sims 4 mod lets you have up to 24 Sims in one house, which is your new household limit. However, we’ve found that 24 is enough for almost all types of gameplay, so it shouldn’t be much of a problem. And the reason why the creator has included this rule is just to make sure that our systems can run the game with so many Sims active in one place without crushing.
As Electronic Arts explains on its official page , each household can have a maximum of 8 Sims, regardless of the type of stage they are in, babies, children, adults or the elderly. In fact, the game throws a warning or problem to warn you when you are already at the limit of the members of a family. In short, each house can have up to 8 inhabitants.
Having only space for eight people in your home can be a bummer for some. So, with the Sims 4 household mod, you can now have 8 plus members in your house, isn’t that amazing? So, go ahead and read this further to find out ways to include up to 24 people in your sim’s house!

If you’re still new to the game and are wondering “How many Sims can be in a household in Sims 4?” then the answer is 8. The reason why this rule is so annoying is that some people like big families. Or rather, we all sometimes want to play with big families that have more than 8 Sims in one house. It’s fun, it’s engaging, and it’s harmless!
In all games, the number of Sims (and pets, if available) that can be in a household is limited. Without a pet-related expansion pack, household size is limited to eight. The The Sims: Unleashed and The Sims 4: Cats & Dogs expansion packs does not change this limit; a household can have any number of Sims and pets as long as the total does not exceed eight. The pets expansions for The Sims 2 and The Sims 3 keep the eight-Sim limit and limit the number of pets to six, but increase the household size limit to ten. This allows an eight-Sim household to have one or two pets. However, it is impossible to create a household with more than eight Sims and pets in Create a Sim in The Sims 2. The Sims 2 Pets for console decreases the household size limit to 6, and limits the number of pets to five which counts up to the household limit.[confirmation needed]
When it comes to the number of Sims in a world, that is to say at a general level in all the worlds, you can create all the families you want in The Sims 4, although respecting the rule of 8 maximum characters in each one of them. The maximum number of inhabitants in the world of a game is 80, but by doing the following steps you can change this option:
In Sims 4, we have the freedom to create as many families as we want. We can find them peaceful neighborhoods, build them cozy homes, and even send them on vacations. But we can’t always create the ideal family for ourselves, simply because of one silly rule – the household number limit! And the only way to remove the household limit in Sims 4 is to use a mod!

## Create mods for sims 4.

If you aren’t sure where to start, then you have nothing to worry about. The first step is to download the actual mod. The file should be copy-pasted to your Mods folder inside your Sims 4 directory. After that, just head over into the game and check the “Script Mods Allowed” option, which can be located in the “Settings Other”. And you’re all done!
The Full Hosue mod is one of the most useful tools for The Sims 4. And even if you aren’t planning on creating a 20-Sims family, the option to have as many Sims as you want in your household is pretty amazing. We’ve played with this mod since the start of the game and we’ll keep on doing so until the end. So get yourself some more cats, dogs, aliens, vampires, and what not! Happy simming!
The mod that we use to increase the household limit in Sims 4 is called Full House Mod. You may have heard of it since it’s a very popular tool shared among the community. Its creator is TwistedMexi and the mod has been a part of the game since 2014. It works properly even to this day and we heavily recommend it to you!
@escapedpolarbear Nope, sorry, the game won't let you add another sim or pet without mods. If the issue is the mods' other features, you could use NRaas MasterController: it does absolutely nothing unless you issue a command. So you could use the "add sim" function on the sim(s) you want in your household, then otherwise play as if you had no mods installed at all.There are limits to MC's ability to add sims: for example, it does not allow for a pregnancy above the game's limit, nor does it allow for creating overstuffed households through the "move in" function. (Other mods do that.) But if you just want to add and remove sims to your household through commands, it works great.
And then you have to think about each of the Sim’s personalities and how you’re going to build the home for them. If you’re having trouble with this, we’re totally recommending these 5 ideas to improve your building. They can come in pretty handy, especially if you’re using the Sims 4 household limit mod!
