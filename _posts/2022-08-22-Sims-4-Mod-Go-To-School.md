## Create a mod for the sims 4 that allows sims to attend school.

You should use the Sims 4 Go to School mod as the best school tool for the game. The first thing you need to do is to download and install the actual mod. Second, you’ll need to place one of the two new avenues on a lot. And third, you’ll need to send your Sims to attend school!

Telford created a mod that’ll allow your Sims to drop out of school (and get a real job- if they’re teens, but that part is optional). My idea is that my Sim children will learn all they need to learn through my school club, so there’s no need for traditional school. Instead, my Sims get up every morning at 7, head to the school club at 8, increase their skills there until 2:30 pm and then head home.
This is a mod I made because I felt like the school system in TS4 was so simple and unrealistic, it drove me crazy, so I revamped it, and I am sharing it with you guys! I hope you like, it is something that I spent weeks, followed by months on, getting it to work in game was the hardest part. Anyways, I hope you enjoy it, your Sims can have a fresh breath of a realistic school system now!!!
This nifty and unique mod by zero allows your genius sims to skip high schools and enroll directly for the university. It’s pretty close to the real world university enrollment situation in the sense that the chances for the jump from high school to university are meager. Lousy institute performance and you will kill your chances.
When everyone’s getting a piece of the cake, why should we leave kid sims behind, even they deserve to have their mod? Here is a beautiful Elementary School you can send them to and follow their school days closely. This school is gushed with unique classrooms, halls, warm ambiance, and beautifully designed buildings and the best part is that everything in the lot is interactive and made of vanilla base game items. So you don’t need to download any new sims 4 mods for school CC to make this look great.

Often gamers can feel marginalized as they don’t see what goes around in the school. This is not the case anymore, as now you can follow your sims to their institutes and help them with their studies. The Sims 4 go to school mod allows you to study a separate subject each day with an NPC teacher and demonstrate your working know-how through various activity goals.
There are more awesome features in this mod, but I’d like you to explore them for yourself. In a nutshell, the Go to School mod is the complete school experience for Sims 4. It introduces everything you’d ever need in a school mod, so I recommend you try it.
I'm also a modder within the Sims community (a novice, no doubt), but I started thinking of ways to make Go to School work again. I don't have the skillset to create a mod like Zerbu's, or even the know-how to fix his broken one, but I was able to create a workaround, which uses Get Together's immersive club system.
Without a doubt, the school system in The Sims 4 is one of the most disappointing features of the game. It’s practically non-existent since our child and teen Sims simply “disappear” when they go to school, and we don’t see them a few hours later. And the gameplay really feels empty without school. As a solution, here I’ll tell you everything you need to know about the Go to School mod for The Sims 4!

## Design a realistic school environment for the sims 4.

Schools make a come-back in The Sims 4, but not as rabbitholes like in The Sims 3. They're like jobs, as Sims will walk towards their lot's spawn point and disappear until school for that day is over. With The Sims 4: High School Years, the high school is an actual building that can be edited freely. However, the high school lot type cannot be placed in other worlds, due to the whole neighborhood of Rockridge Heights in Copperdale required for the school to function to its fullest.
We tried building an Elementary School and liked the integration between the Builder Tools and The Sims 4 High School Years. Although, due to the limitations of The Sims 4 High School Years Expansion Pack, there are limited options for several of the requirements. Hopefully, more creators release cc that fills the requirements of The Sims 4 High School Years pack since they will also be used for Go To School.
The Sims 4 High School Years is the franchise’s first-ever foray into the teenage high school experience, where you get to tag along with your Sims to experience the highs and lows of the most awkward, but also occasionally the most memorable, moments of their lives. Let’s be honest though, high school can kind of suck, and boy, I could have used some life-altering cheat codes or mods in IRL when I was a very shy teen. But hey, at least I can make the whole thing better in The Sims 4.
You can even set up a school uniform using the club menu. Go to the “Modify Club Outfits” option in the Club UI and set up custom uniforms for your school. My school uniforms are navy and blue/black and white, similar to the ones I wore in elementary school in real life :)
Go to School has faculty (Principal, Caterer, and Janitor) and specific subjects. Also, each school day, there are activity-based goals for students to complete. (Note from Zerbu: If you’ve used V4, you might notice there’s no object for the counsellor. I have plans to bring back the counsellor at some point, but the NPC stickers will be optional, so custom schools won’t require any CC.)
Luckily, modders have been making school-themed stuff for some time, even before this pack released (that’s especially thanks to the popularity of the Go to School Mod). Severinka’s school sets are among some of the best for just how stylish and modern the pieces of furniture look, with light brown wooden desks, cabinets, and a world map that can be placed on a wall.
High School Years comes with a bunch of new items, as well as some cool debug items (A ferris wheel and a haunted house? Yes please), but there’s always room for more when you’re building the ultimate high school. And sticking with only the official pack items can be limiting if you’re really into decorating and building.
This visit’s whole point is to present yourself, your home, and your child to the Headmaster. This means that you must be very agreeable, likable, and appear as a high-class citizen. And this also includes doing all kinds of things to keep your guest engaged and interested in your family. You will actually get a set of goals that you’ll need to hit throughout the encounter, like talking on specific topics and showing off unique possessions.
