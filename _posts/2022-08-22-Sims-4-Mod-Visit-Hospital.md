## A mod for the popular sims game visits a hospital to give the players a unique experience.

Another thing I see often is that people want to visit the hospitals they see on the internet. In reality, a lot of YouTubers have custom-made hospitals that introduce new places in the game. For example, this Private Practice mod is one of the best extensions for the game. It adds a brand new hospital and a new job/career for your Sims.

The base game of Sims 4 doesn’t have an actual hospital lot, but it offers all the medical processes. In the base game, the hospital is just another “rabbit hole” where your Sims disappear for a couple of hours and days. And just like with schools, you can’t see what you’re Sims are doing while there.
I hope this guide helped you figure out where the hospital is in Sims 4 and how to reach it. Unfortunately, the situation is not ideal, especially if you don’t own the Get to Work DLC. In that case, I suggest you download and install a mod that adds a hospital to your game. I mentioned the Private Practice mod above, so maybe try that one first.
However, if you visit the Willow Creek Hospital, you’ll actually see the hospital. You’ll see doctors and patients occupying the lot. You can send your Sim for a number of different reasons in the hospital. Also, if you play with the doctor career, your Sims will get to work there too!
On the other hand, you can also visit the hospital if your Sim is a doctor. As a doctor, your Sim will perform different kinds of tasks, mainly around treating patients. You’ll get to go to all rooms in the hospital buildings and experience the entire career.

Hospital is a special lot assignment in The Sims 4: Get to Work, accessible for Sims working in the doctor career and for pregnant Sims who are going into labor (with up to one companion). There is only one hospital in the game, which is located in the Civic Center sub-neighborhood. The lot assignment can't be given to other lots without mods, so they are not available anywhere else.
SICK VISIT APPOINTMENT: Before this update, you were unable to go to the doctor to get a diagnosis for your Sim's Sickness. Now, if the illness is something that is pushed by this mod, your Sim can get a diagnosis of what ails them as well as get medication to cure it.
You can find the Sims 4 hospital in the Civic Center neighborhood of the Willow Creek world. The hospital is simply called Willow Creek Hospital, and it’s a community lot that can’t be edited without cheats. You must own The Sims 4: Get to Work expansion pack to visit the hospital.
