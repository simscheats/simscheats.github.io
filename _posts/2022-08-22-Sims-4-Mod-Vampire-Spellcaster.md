The concept of vampires is so alluring and beguile that every one of us in their lifetimes has at least for once stumbled upon the possibility of them being real, well who knows they might be real but who knows. But if you are looking for some more content to feed your imagination and thought process, then Electronic Arts serves you with sims 4: vampire mods.

You can also unlock new vampire powers and features as you further advance in-game using all-new tools in the sims 4 game. Take a look at our collection of vampire mod sims 4.

What’s scarier than a vampire? Vampire children of course. While vampire Sims can have babies in the Sims 4, the vampire traits and abilities only begin to show up when your Sims are in their teenage years. This mod corrects that issue and now your Vampire children can feed on other Sims, making it a family affair!
If you’re looking to get a bit more into the nitty gritty of Sims 4 modding, look no further than UI Cheats by weebesu. It lets you tweak and cheat the game from the UI, meaning you don’t have to type any commands to do your bidding. You can right click on any value you want to set it, meaning you have ultimate control to play God with your Sims. The time can be set, money can be added or taken away, and promotion tasks can be finished instantly. It essentially gives you control over every aspect of your Sims’ lives, so use it wisely.
Vampires are a staple occult type in the Sims Universe. While we love our beloved blood-sucking creatures of the night, there can always be more content when playing the Sims. Enter in the modding community, which makes expansive and creative mods for us everyday Simmers. These top ten vampires mods are sure to expand on your gameplay and make your Sim stories more engaging.
This module can get considered as the Sims 4 immersive vampire mod that can add more vampirism powers, where you can put more energy. For example, you need energy while facilitating mirror reflections, stops hissing, and getting immune to sunlight. But this modification will fade away after a week of playing. So, you better save it for those days when you need to go out in daylight.

## Use vampire spells to control the minds of your sims.

Maybe have a sim mate with a Vampire to have a baby. Age up baby to toddler then have parent bake a cake, add birthday candles, parent helps toddler blow out candles, toddler turns into a child, the child add birthday candles & blows them out, turns into a teen then repeat until young adult. The young adult meets & mates to have a baby with a Spellcaster. Repeat the Age up & birthdays. If the new teen doesn't have an added occult in their genetics, get the parents to try again. FYI make sure that one parent can become pregnant & the other can get his mate pregnant.
Have a regular vampire perform the Bite Neck interaction. A regular vampire can also turn Sims into vampires, but like with the Grand Vampire, the two must have a good relationship. However, with a playable Sim, you can just select Bite Neck and let the transformation happen!
I cured one of my Vamps, didn't like it because my sim lost her pretty pointy fangs & glowing eyes. So I just gave back her Vamp traits.I don't have any mods in my games. Adding a new Occult Trait is easy, as long as you know the exact codes to type in for your sim.
That's where Zero's "Don't Turn My Sims into Spellcasters" mod comes in. It's a tuning mod that will only use pre-made Spellcasters to fill in any Spellcaster roles needed, or generate new ones, giving you better control over the story your game tells.
Added a Mass version of Dispel Enchantment, found under Spells Mass. This can be used to dispel Stasis Field easily on a lot of sims at once, if you've used the Mass version of Stasis Field. It will also dispel any other spells that are built to involve the Dispel Enchantment command.
Getting a vampire to turn your Sim into one of the undead can be difficult. Vlad is of course always up for the task but you have to befriend him first and he’s also evil, which is inconvenient at times. The Vampirify spell takes away the hassle of becoming a vampire and lets your Spellcaster turn any Sim into a vampire. Gaining this power comes with a price: it cannot be taught by sages or through duels, the Sim can only learn it once they have reached level 13 of the vampire lore skill, and only after they have unlocked the hidden chapter of The Ultimate Vampire Compendium.
Ask the vampire to bite your Sim. When your Sim has built up a high enough relationship with the vampire, click on the vampire and select Ask to Turn. If the relationship is high enough, the vampire will either bite your Sim on the wrist (if the relationship is platonic) or on the neck (if the two are romantically involved).
An unfortunate result of the vampire’s never-ending thirst for blood is that they constantly prey on your nonvampire Sims. This means that they get quite insistent, constantly trying to get your Sims in discrete locations so they can suck their blood.
