## Game crashes when trying to open the mod manager.

Before we start with any other solution, we will check whether the mod files which you have placed in the mods folder are in the correct format. Normally, the format in which the mod files are when you download them from the creator’s website is .zip. The reason why the game cannot view and operate the contents of the .zip file is that the game engine is not designed to unzip the package each and every time as this will consume a lot of time and CPU energy.

Every game has a cache folder which it uses for its operations and the running of the game. Since the cache files are created at runtime and may be leftover, there are chances that some of them get corrupt. When this occurs, the game causes unexpected behavior including the mods not working as required. In this solution, we will navigate to the cache folder and clear it.
ive heard other people have this problem it says mods disabledyour game has just been updated. all mods have been disabled because it is possible they conflict with the update. i tried everything and the only thing i havent tried is making a backup an0d deleting all the files then rebuilding it almost file by file. i dont want to do that any other solutions?
Bad mods: If there are any corrupt or bad mods in your mods directory, there is a possibility that the entire batch of mods will not work. Here we have to apply a technique where we test each mod one by one to find the culprit and disregard it from the folder.
Hi @lovelucidly,Make sure Origin is not set to disable the mods:Right click on the game in your game library in Origin, and go to Properties.Go to Advanced launch settings tabIs there anything written in the Command line arguments option? If you find something related to mods, like "-mods", delete it.Was that the problem?Mai

If the steps above don’t alleviate the issue, you may need to check the mod compatibility. This can usually be done on the mod’s download page. Make sure the downloaded mod version corresponds with your current game version and that you’ve made the necessary game updates.
If the mod itself needs an update, make sure to leave a comment about it on its download page. However, if there is no issue with compatibility, try checking whether the mod package is unzipped. Depending on your PC operating system, the instructions for unzipping a folder differ slightly.
@Obert914 From what you're describing, you've tried to enable your mods again and they keep disabling, is that correct ?If so, could you check on the game version in the file called GameVersion.txt in your doc folder. Open it with a text editor and see if it says 1.75.125. If not, it's probably a matter of your Antivirus program blocking your user folder from updating which causes the mod disabling loop.Are you using Avast or AVG ?There's more info on this here: https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues-PC/CURRENT-ISSUE-Anti-Virus-blocking-User-Folder-Screensh...If that's not your problem, then simply re-enable them ingame.
@Obert914 It is per design. Have you tried to change the settings in Game Options to enable mods again? I think you might need to reload the game to be able to do that. To avoid all the issues you will see from a quick read in this section I would advice not to enable your mods though, but to remove the mods folder and wait to replace it until you have found new versions for all mods and CC in it, that are compatible with the new game patch.

## Modding in sims 4 not possible anymore.

Lastly, if none of these step’s help, you may want to look online for users with a similar issue. Head to Sims 4 or EA Games forums and search for threads dedicated to that specific trait and the term “mod not working.” Perhaps, the issue is well-known, and The Sims 4 community has already found a solution.
There was a universal issue in Sims 4 where at a point, the game stopped supporting mods altogether whether they were enabled or not. This caused a global outrage to players regarding the mod’s functionality and they were unable to customize their game in any way. Electronic Arts were fast to release an update that circumvented the issue. If you have an older version of Sims 4 installed, it is recommended that you follow the method below to update it to the latest build.
Finally, uninstalling and reinstalling the Sims 4 is the last resort to fix mods notworking problem. You can completely remove the Sims 4 from your computer and then download the latest version of the game from the official website. Then, install the game according to the given instruction and check if Sims 4 mods not showing up issue is removed.
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
@Queen_Mia1228 Do you run the standard version of Sims 4, or the Legacy Edition? If you have the standard version, you'll need to make sure your mods are fully updated for the current patch. If you have the LE, you'll need to specifically download mods made for or confirmed to be compatible with the LE; the newer ones won't work.
Like mentioned before, Sims 4 rolled out an update where users were given an option in-game which allowed them to enable/disable the mods. Previously, this wasn’t the case and the game would automatically load all the mods as long as they were in the mods folder. In this solution, we will navigate to the in-game options and make sure that the option is enabled.
If your mods won’t work after installing the latest Sims 4 updates, make sure to update them to the latest version and unzip your mod packages. Then, clear your game cache and repair your Sims 4 game files. Check if your mod list includes a faulty mod and delete it. You can also create a new household and reinstall the game.
Another thing to check is the mod compatibility with your current Sims 4 game. We came across several different cases where the mod author didn’t update the existing version of the mod to be compatible with the latest version of Sims which caused the mod to conflict and not work as expected. Navigate to the official mod website and check if the current version of the mod which you have been using is working properly in Sims 4. You can also take a look at different forums.
