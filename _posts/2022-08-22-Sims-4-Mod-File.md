## How to install a sims 4 mod file.

Next up, you‚Äôll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can‚Äôt tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include ‚ÄúMod The Sims‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Sims Resource‚Äù, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.

When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer‚Äôs built-in search box to help you locate the folder.
After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4.¬†The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the¬†Mods folder, there is a ‚ÄúResource.cfg‚Äù file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you‚Äôre browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.

Installing Mods and Custom Content in The Sims 4 is very easy for both PC and Mac, if your aren‚Äôt sure how to do it, I wrote a quick but detailed tutorial for you to read. Most of the Mods or Custom Content files you can download are .package or .pyo/.py files that come in a compressed ZIP or RAR format.
Remember that game mods and custom content are designed to work with genuine versions of The Sims 4. There is no guarantee that they will work with pirated versions of the game, so if you do have a pirated version and a mod isn't working, that could be why. The only way to fix this would be to buy a copy of The Sims 4 directly from Origin, where you can ensure the game will be patched regularly and compatible with all mods and custom content.
Installing script mods is again, pretty similar to installing the other mods listed above. The main difference, however, is that the file type will end in .ts4script. For these kind of mods, you'll still put them into your Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods folder, but you'll also need to make sure in your game settings that you have Script Mods enabled.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).

## How to uninstall a sims 4 mod file.

To reset your mods folder for Sims 4, open the ‚ÄúMy Documents‚Äù folder, and then open the ‚ÄúElectronic Arts‚Äù folder. Inside the ‚ÄúElectronic Arts‚Äù folder, you‚Äôll find a file called ‚ÄúS4_Mods_Default.‚Äù Open this file and delete all of the files inside of it.
@SantaFeAtBay¬†You can delete the mods fully by opening your Sims 4 folder in My Documents and in the mod folder delete all mods, in your case you can just delete the entire folder.¬†You will then need to clear the Sims 4 cache which you can do by deleting the file¬†localthumbscache.package¬†which is the folder in which your¬†Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/ cache can be found.You also need to delete all files that end in .cache¬†but leave the actual directory.¬†Now go ahead and go back to thecachestr folder. Delete all of the files but once again do not delete the actual directory.If you see a folder¬†called¬†onlinethumbnailcache¬†then you can go ahead and trash it too.
If your mods aren't working properly in Sims 4, there are free tools created by the modding community that will help you find and remove files. The process can be tedious, but the best way is to use Sims 4 Studio (a free tool for creating custom content) and Sims 4 Tray Importer.

Now, you need to figure out if your game is properly installed and functional. To do that, you'll open your folder Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods (this will remove mods and CC, to remove saves and everything else do the same with the entire "The Sims 4" folder instead, but it's something only necessary in very few cases), then you will DELETE everything inside (remember that you made the backup above? yes, you'll need those files üòâ):
This will open the Mods folder and automatically highlight the file you selected in Sims 4 Tray Importer. Right click on the file and delete it. The Sims 4 Tray Importer will automatically delete files from your Mods folder for you, but only if you downloaded the separate file .package instead of the merged file. If you downloaded the merged file .package file, all mods will be removed.

There are a few ways to uninstall mods. The most common way is to go to the mod‚Äôs installation directory (usually found in your Steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Data\ folder) and delete the files that were installed with the mod. Another way is to use the ‚ÄúUninstall‚Äù option in the game‚Äôs launcher.
