## Religious mods for sims 4.

The Sims 4 mod that we’re discussing here today is called Rambunctious Religions. It was originally shared with us in 2020, and we owe many thanks to its creator Lumpinou. She has done some wonderful work in the past, and you should definitely check her page.

One thing that we always struggled to accept in this game is the absence of the occult, believers, worshippers, cult leaders, and fanatics. There are all kinds of people in our modern-day society, so why can’t there be all kinds of Sims as well? Well, the Sims 4 religion mod that we’re going to showcase here takes care of all that. It introduces many new things to the game, such as brand new religions, cults, and other things that simmers desperately miss!
First of all, we should get something very clear: this mod doesn’t introduce real-life religions in The Sims 4. Instead, it brings us made-up religions with no connections to Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, or any other faith. These imaginary religions are meant to be funny and entertaining, much like the rest of the game. And for that, we give our thumbs up!
***
NOTE: be aware, this is NOT about putting real religions in the Sims. This is a Sim-like take on faith, which means, it’s meant to be as humorous as life-emulating; it doesn’t take itself (or real life) too seriously, and is almost a soft parody at times. It is not meant to be disrespectful to anyone or anything.
Okay, so this Sims 4 religion mod gives you 4 new religions: the Congregation of non-Believers, the Cult of the Cowplant, the Worship of the Watcher, and the Treaders of the Occult. They all worship different things, but in the end, they’re all religions. Your Sims can become members of any of them, and they can also convert later on. You can do new interactions and social activities with your religion. Hence, it offers a new and engaging type of gameplay.

For a game that primarily focuses on simulating real-life, The Sims 4 does a very poor job regarding religion. Not only do we not have religion, but we also don’t have religious traits or even a church in Sims 4. Faith plays a big part in our world, and not having it in TS4 really sucks. But not anymore because we finally have a working Sims 4 religion mod!
The Rambunctious Religions mod brings us 4 new religions in Sims 4. Each of them is unique and believes in different things. Sims can choose whether to join one or another but cannot be active in two religions simultaneously. Here’s what you should know about the 4 religions.
To become a member of any of these religions, you’re going to need “The Holy Book”. This is an item that comes together with this Sims 4 mod, and you can get it from the build mode. Once you have the book, your Sims can read it and educate themselves about the 4 different religions.
The Sims 4 doesn’t feature any specific religion or spirituality-related activities. Incorporating faith into the game is a tricky task. While many players would like to see more faith-based content in The Sims 4, that’s a very delicate line for EA to tread. Not to mention that getting it right is very hard.
