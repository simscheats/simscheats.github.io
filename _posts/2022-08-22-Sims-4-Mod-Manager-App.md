## The sims 4 mod manager app allows players to manage and install mods for their game.

The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!

Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
If you ask why, then you’re on the right track to make your life a lot easier. You see, the Mod Manager is a quality of life, fully developed software that helps you organize all The Sims 4 files. If you’ve ever found yourself in the mess of all the additional mods and CC you download for the game, then this is your ticket out of that hell!
Titled ‘Sims 4 Mod Manager’, this tool is currently in the early stages of development. If one studies its mechanism, one feels that this is the kind of tool that can help one save up on a lot of time by simplifying the process of eliminating custom content that you don’t require anymore.
The Sims 4 Mod/Custom Content Manager also makes the process of enabling and disabling Sims 4 mods and custom content from just one designated place, instead of transferring elements in and out of the Mods folder. The tool works most efficiently if you have a proper system in place. The tool is very new and yet to be properly tested by a large number of players. Therefore, the company is taking all the feedback it is getting about the tool very seriously and making changes to improve it constantly.

Anyone who uses Mods or Custom Content in The Sims 4, or even from any of previous The Sims games, will know that your Mods folder can sometimes feel a little overwhelming. However, GameTimeDev has created a program to help players keep their Mods folder organized.
If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)
About Mods and Custom ContentMods and Custom Content are wildly popular among Sims 4 players, but if you're new to the franchise you may be unaware what treasures await those who ravenously scour the web for the latest downloads. There is far more free content available to download than is included in the base game and all game/stuff packs combined. In this guide, I'll teach you how to install CC and mods, explain what they are and offer some direction on where to go from here by providing links to sites where you can binge-download CC for your game.
The Mod & Custom Content Manager is described as a file explore with additional features which allows you to browse your files for The Sims 4 easily. You are able to delete and move files but also disable and enables files both on their own, in multiples or even whole folders. View files alongside thumbnails, which will help you distinguish content that is for Build Buy Mode or Create A Sim.

## The sims 4 mod manager app is available on the app store and google play.

Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
And if you click on the furthermost tool in the same corner, the one labeled Open The Sims 4 “Mods” folder, you will be directed to the destination of your installed mod. Notice that if a mod isn’t checked/selected in the main list on the Mod Manger, then it won’t be shown in the folder either.
On Windows 10, the default location for The Sims 4 is C:\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods. Navigate to your Mods folder, and then click and drag the folder to your desktop. EA always disables custom content for every patch update, but perform this step anyway just as an extra precaution.
As you can see from my name, i'm a noob with mods. Never tried it before.But I wanted to try to get some new hairstyles, aka CC as far as i understand, and i found one I really liked on TSR and clicked download. Then I moved the .package file into the mods folder in the Sims 4 folder. I had already checked that mods were enabled in the gamesettings, but when i started my game, it just gave me an error message saying some necessary game content is missing or damaged, but if i remove the .package file, the game starts up normally. I have also tried another cc instead, thinking that maybe it was just the file that was not working, but the same thing happened.Any idea how to fix it?
The Sims Resource - TSR is also a high quality site for downloading CC, and like MTS features content for Sims 3 as well. If you get addicted to CC you may even want to join as a VIP, which makes mass-downloading items much easier and removes ads from the site.
I have windows and I have no clue how to download stuff from the Sims Resource. it is really annoying me, I have tried absolutely everything and I have been trying for about 3 weeks. today I have already sat here for 4 hours please help I am being driven to insanity!!!! :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(
Hi, I have a problem, I followed all the steps, but when I download the mods and put them in the folder it still doesn't appear in the game, there is this window telling me about the mods that I downloaded but they still don't appear in the game... Can someone help me?
Hi I know How to download mods and I do put my CC in the mods folder. However when I launch my game it comes up with the mods list (as it should) and shows all the CC I downloaded but then when I go to the actual create a Sim some of my CC don't show up?
