## Create new sims 4 mod parts.

You can find many mods over at ModTheSims, which hosts a wealth of community-made free mods for you to download and enjoy as you please. Installing mods is simple enough – all you need to do is drag the mod files over to the game’s mod folder. In a typical setup, this should be Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.

And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?
Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
The Sims 4 makes it easier than ever: simply download the mod in question, unzip the files (they will typically end in .package), and then drag and drop them into the "Mods" folder, which is already located in your Sims files (navigate to Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4Mods to locate).
Mods for the sims 4 include things like attending school with your children, having tragedies happen to your sims, and so much more. Below are 100+ mods that you can download for The Sims 4 that will change the game and are all really great options if you need to mix it up.

The options for mods are pretty diverse. I've seen everything from one for The Sims 2 which added horses to the game (and yes, Sims could even ride them—and this was way before the Pets expansion pack added horses to The Sims 3), to one for Sims 3 which added in a working Ferris wheel. Some are much less complex, just restructuring the regular game files to add in or change things (like a Sims 3 mod which allows late-night bars to stay open 24 hours instead of closing at 2 a.m., or the most famous mod of all, the one that removes the pixelation on nude Sims and replaces it with body parts).
You should never have to pay for any sims 4 mods ever, this includes custom content too. There are actually rules that come directly from EA that state that you are not allowed to have things behind permanent pay walls and are only allowed to have these items on early access on things like Patreon but you must eventually make these items available for free.
These sims 4 mods have all been in my game at some point and have all brought me immense amounts of joy in the game. I absolutely love adding sims 4 mods because the game can get stale if you playa every single day for years and years. Hopefully you enjoyed this list of mods and it can inspire you to play something more exciting!
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.

## Get sims 4 mod parts approved by ea.

Since sims 4 mods aren’t created by or maintained by EA there is always a chance that something in a mod can conflict with the way the game operates, especially since The Sims 4 is consistently updated. You want to find sims 4 mods that are consistently updated too because mods can break often, and can break your game if they aren’t updated.
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.
In the post, EA acknowledges how mods are an important part of the gameplay experience for most of The Sims 4 community, and it supports this. It also explained to readers how to go about reenabling their mods after they were automatically disabled following the most recent update to the game.
The update to policy also means that the Early Access mods will not be allowed or supported. Early Access mods typically meant that users could donate to a creator's Patreon to access various mods before they became open to the public. As a result of EA's update, mods for The Sims 4 must be free from the very beginning, and the Early Access pay model must be scrapped.
Something that is severely lacking in The Sims 4 is good skin tones for all sims, but especially darker skin tones. Hopefully the December 2020 patch will fix this problem, but until then we have modders like Xmiramira (Patreon) created custom content skin mod packs that add beautiful skin tones for your sims that look much more real.
This might seem like good news at first glance. All mods are free, which means you can download custom content to your hearts content, and that's great. However, these changes to policy are actually far from good for the creators of The Sims 4 custom content, who have arguably made the game what it is today. While mods not being locked behind permanent paywalls is certainly a good thing, not allowing creators to use Early Access is going to put many who earn an income from The Sims 4 custom content at a detriment.
Permanent pay walls have been a persistent frustration for a while now, with some creators locking content behind paid tiers indefinitely. While this should hopefully be addressed given EA's new policy, it's sad to see that one of the most popular avenues for earning money for your time and efforts as a The Sims 4 creator might not be possible anymore.
The policy changes detail that creators must not promote their mods "in a way that suggests they are endorsed by or affiliated with The Sims, Maxis, or Electronic Arts." Creators cannot use any of the games branding in their content when promoting mods, but they can state that the mod is obviously for The Sims 4, or a relevant expansion pack.
