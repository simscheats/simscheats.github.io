## How to mod sims 4 on a macbook

Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.

To download the Sims 4 Mod Manager, all you need to do is head to the program's page over on Mod The Sims. Note: At the time of writing this overview, the Sims 4 Mod Manager has been released on PC and a first test version of the program for MacOS has been released.... see details ›
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
Lastly, if none of these step’s help, you may want to look online for users with a similar issue. Head to Sims 4 or EA Games forums and search for threads dedicated to that specific trait and the term “mod not working.” Perhaps, the issue is well-known, and The Sims 4 community has already found a solution.
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.

Another factor that you need to keep in mind is that the system requirements might change depending on the updates provided for the mod. With the Sims 4 mod installer, you can ensure that all your mods are in sync with the system requirements. If there is a mod that isn’t in sync, it will be removed or sorted out.
Unfortunately, Sims 4 doesn’t have mod support for the PS4. Games generally have minimal modding options on consoles, and games that allow you to change the gameplay are a minority. The developer has no current plans to enable custom content on the PS4, so don’t get your hopes up.
Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)

We generally don’t support players pirating games. Mods also bring this to the next level. Since pirated (or cracked) game versions often are slightly outdated or have a few different installation files, so there’s no guarantee that mods that work for legitimate Sims 4 copies will work for pirated ones.
You need to keep in mind the fact that custom content and game mods are actually made by the players. Neither of these two is actually supported by the maker of the game which is the EA. This is why you will never see the game creators fixing the causal factor of the error. The mods are always set for use at self risk. So, your best move is to opt for a custom content download manager for sims 4 to avoid any probable glitches.
Sims 4 files are stored in two folders, one located in Program Files and the second one in Documents/Electronic Arts/TheSims4. Check the second location. If the folder is not there, chances are you’ve accidentally deleted it, or the game failed to create it. Not to worry – that’s fixable.
The best way to avoid any in-game errors is to work through your Mods folder every time you have any update for the game patch. With use of the Sims 4 CC organizer, you can resume the game with regular mod or cc updates. This helps with smooth operation all through the game.
Okay, thank you. I dragged the .packages into the mods sub folder and when I opened the sims 4 game it read “Mods: Maxis does not pre-screen or support mods. Please use with caution”. The two mods I dragged were under the “custom content” instead of being under “script mods”. When I went into create a sim mode neither of my mods were there. What am I supposed to do now?
If mods are enabled in the game settings, disable them, and restart the game. Then, relaunch the game and enable mods. However, if mods were disabled, do the opposite and enable them and then restart the game. Check for a newly created “Mods” folder in your “Documents/Electronic Arts/TheSims4” folder.... view details ›
Hey, I have been able to get as far as getting my .package files through to Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods. The Recourse.cfg is not allowing any of mods to be downloaded, therefore I cannot get them into the game. What am I supposed to do ?
After launching The Sims 4, the game will think that you're not connected to the internet and you'll be switched to Offline Mode. This can also be done by going in The Sims 4's Settings panel and selecting ”Other”. From there, just untick the ”Online Access” option and you'll play the game Offline.... view details ›
