Using this mod, the Sims are not just happy but experience true happiness. The Sims can only be happy when a happy event takes place in the game, this includes meeting a crush or eating something good. Because of this, the Sims have a genuine reason to be happy.
The interactions are also very realistic, from reactions to behaviors of all Sims on the event. Plus it’s a great way to earn a gold medal reward based on how well you threw the party, so if you’re even mildly interested, then we recommend trying out this one-of-a-kind mod!
The success of the game is driven by a thriving and lively bunch of modders who are responsible for creating tons of weird and wonderful additions to the game. If you’re looking for some excellent mods that will enhance your Sims 4 gaming experience, here are some great options you should consider.
We are constantly looking for more interactions and deeper game play and sometimes you just want your sims to be nice to each other and appreciate the things the other can do. This praise and admiration mod is awesome and adds a bunch of new interactions for praising, admiration and compliments.

This is one of my MUST HAVE, no matter what, always installed mods in The Sims 4. This mod allows you to click directly on the games UI to execute cheat commands. For example, if you click on a sim’s relationship with their spouse you can change their relationship values to increase or decrease their romance and friendship.
In The Sims 4 we are only given 3 slots for choosing traits for our sims which is a down grade from 5 in The Sims 3, which is disappointing. Thankfully, modders like Vicky Sims (patreon) create mods that you can use to add more traits which can help give your sims more personality.
Since 2019 I've been working on this website to help sims players get the most out of their gameplay and have the best time playing The Sims 4. I am obsessed with this game and have been for decades and love to share my love of the game with all of you.
The showtime mod created by Kawaii Stacie (Patreon) is a mod that allows your sims to turn their hobbies like singing and dancing into a full on career. There are rabbit hole events allowing your sims to go to singing or dancing gigs. It’s a great mod that makes it fun to play again!
