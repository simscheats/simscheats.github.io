But even though that definition is a little vague, vintage clothing (especially styles from the 1900s) is remarkably identifiable. Vintage dresses, specifically, are a great way to spice up your sim’s wardrobe – whether your Sim is the “born in the wrong era” type, or a bona fide historical sim.
If your sims are not into suits, you need to have a backup plan, and we’re sure this collection is a great alternative. It contains 5 dresses, in addition to a pair of earrings to level up the entire look of your sim. For easy download, follow this page.

## These mods can be downloaded from the mod the sims website.

Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
To update your mods, you will need to return to wherever you downloaded them. The creator will either announce that the mod is compatible with the latest patch and does not need an update, or they will release an updated version of their mod. Give creators a few days to get around to this. They try their best, but they’re still human beings with lives of their own outside of The Sims. Yes, this means you will either have to avoid playing your game for a while after an update, or deal with playing without your mods. That’s just how the cookie crumbles, I’m afraid.
Of course, this is the hardest and the most troublesome way of doing this for two main reasons. First, it takes a lot of time. And second, you might end up deleting all the mods and CC that you love. And I do NOT recommend this way if you’re a total beginner in Sims 4!
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.
The good news is modding your game isn’t as hard as you think. Sims Community is here to help. We’ll be clarifying any technical terms you might come across while looking for mods and CC, dispelling common myths about mods and CC, and walking you through the process of installing and maintaining your mods and CC step-by-step.
