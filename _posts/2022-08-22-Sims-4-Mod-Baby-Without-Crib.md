## Sims 4 mod baby without crib, can be a great way to make your sims lives easier.

Cribs in The Sims 4 are replaced by bassinets (for babies) and toddler beds (for toddlers). Like The Sims, a bassinet is tied to a particular baby until that baby ages up. However, it will not disappear when its current occupant ages up but it can be sold for §150 or be used by babies who are born later in the household.

Have you grown tired of the base game limitations on where you can and can’t place your baby? Don’t worry, those days are over thanks to PandaC‘s brillliant workaround. This mod comes with a bear serving as a virtual anchor so you can use it as a reference. Download it at Mod The Sims, where it has 17000 hits.
In The Sims 2, cribs must be purchased from the Misc. - Children section of Buy mode; they are not provided when a baby is born or adopted. The base game includes The Kinder Kontainer, which costs §275. The Sims 2: FreeTime adds two wooden cribs, the Wonderland Sleigh Crib and the Lil' Jailbird Canopy Crib, which cost §300 and §325, respectively. All cribs in The Sims 2 have an Energy rating of 12.
A crib holds only one baby or toddler at a time. Babies cannot leave the crib without the assistance of a teen or older Sim. This is generally true for toddlers, but toddlers who have learned to walk may sometimes escape from their crib if left unattended.
Lovers of teddy bears and soft colours rejoice: Jomsims has compiled a pack with the complete Acnassy nursery line. This is the perfect one-stop shop for a beautiful baby room. It has plenty of storage space, a beautiful crib with canopy (don’t forget to download the mod for that), seating for parents and friends, and even a cute little rug!
