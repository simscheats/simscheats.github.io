## Create a vampire sims 4 mod.

If you want to make a vampire Sim from scratch, you need only visit the "Add a Sim" option at the left lower corner of the screen in The Sims 4. Click the "add vampire" option. This is a normal game function that does not require any special codes or accessing the cheat code command panel.

A great way to chip yourself in this game and to get the hang of it is to use Mods. They allow you to do things not initially intended by the developers of the base game, like glowing eyes and adding new hair content. The Sims 4 game will enable you to turn yourself and other people in the town into vampires and live forever in an enticing virtual land. You can also unlock new vampire powers and features as you further advance in-game using all-new tools in the sims 4 game. Take a look at our collection of vampire mod sims 4.
The concept of vampires is so alluring and beguile that every one of us in their lifetimes has at least for once stumbled upon the possibility of them being real, well who knows they might be real but who knows. But if you are looking for some more content to feed your imagination and thought process, then Electronic Arts serves you with sims 4: vampire mods. As the name suggests, the game is the fourth version in the sims series that gives you the power to create and control people.
Being a vampire in The Sims 4 is not an easy thing. Despite the regular sunlight, you also have to deal with the obvious shortage of household items, clothes and appearances that makes you feel like a real vampire. For that reason alone, we’ve completed an entire list of the most interesting mods for the game. We’re sure that you’ll find great additions for yourself, so let’s start!
If you were looking for total control over the appearance of your sims, this mod by CmarNYC is just the ticket. It essentially lets you mould and sculpt every aspect of your sims, and works for all human, alien and vampire forms in the game. The link provided also includes a couple of helpful tutorials to get you started.

A great way to put your stamp on a game like The Sims 4 is to use mods. They allow you to do things not initially intended by the developers of the base game, like adding new hair content, or turning into a vampire. They can be a lot of fun to use, but with there being so many and all it's easy to get overwhelmed. To help you out, we've put together this The Sims 4 Mods Guide. It'll list the very best Mods, and give you links to where they can be downloaded.
There are quite a few variations of this mod, but I’m going to choose the Daywalker Mod by Twisted Mexi to represent in this list. A bit self-explanatory, this is a must-have mod for anyone looking to extend the playtime with their Vampire Sims (daytime is far too long for our undead families). Your Vampire Sims can now be invited to daytime pool parties in the summer without frying to a crisp.
When the base vampire makeup doesn’t satisfy us while creating a new Sim, we turn to this mod! The two blood lines are sometimes just the right look when coming up with their dark forms, so you should definitely give it a try. Already popular on The Sims Resource, nearly 70,000 downloads, you can get it for yourself from this link.
I am always a fan of more fleshed-out mods that offer a good amount of content and expand on your gameplay. With this consideration, I must choose the Bloodborne Aspiration as my number one pick for the top vampire mods in The Sims 4. As implied, this mod comes with a new aspiration that will allow you to learn the blood origins of your Vampires and their place in the Vampire world. This new aspiration is a blend of aspirations: Sims will be gaining knowledge, ranking up in multiple careers, exploring different love interests, and of course engaging in vampire affairs. After your Sim has completed all four milestones they will earn one of eight unique traits that assign them to a vampire house. Each house comes with a base mood (this can range from sad to flirty, so beware), an additional bonus trait, and custom whims and social interactions.

## Build a vampire sims 4 community.

You can start this process by going to the Sims who live in Forgotten Hollow and talking to them about vampires. Interactions that have to do with vampires will be denoted with a little vampire bat. There are a few ways you can accomplish the vampire transformation. You can befriend Sims and talk about vampires enough, and even Vladislaus Straud, a Dracula-like Sim, will reach out to you via text message.
If you are controlling the human Sim, your first task will be to befriend a vampire. The NPCs who come shipped with the game generally have normal-human appearances unless they're in their dark form, so it may be tricky to see one just wandering the street. However, you can simply travel to Forgotten Hollow and knock on a random door. Any of the Sims who live in Forgotten Hollow, and the Sims who wander its streets, are generally vampires.
Speaking of turning vampires, becoming a vampire is a significant moment in your Sims life. They’ll move from their short life spans as humans to their new immortal lives as vampires. So why not throw a party? The Vampire Initiation Ritual is just that, a new type of social event where you Sim can celebrate turning into a vampire with those closest to them. You’ll be required to have a Vampire Novice (your unturned Sim), a Senior Vampire, Vampire Guests, and Normal Guests to successfully host the party. Become the life (or death) of the party in this creative add-on to your game.
If you're going the other way and playing as a vampire who wants to turn a human Sim, the process is similar. Simply meet your subject and befriend them however you wish. The difference here is that the relationship threshold can be lower if you're controlling a high-level vampire, and all vampires need the Vampire Creation Vampire Power to execute the turn.
Vampires were introduced to The Sims 4 with the Vampires Game Pack, and they add a dark side of living in suburban SimCity. They are a fully optional feature of the game and are not required to play, though it's a certainty you'll run into a vampire or two roaming about the neighborhood.
This mod by iSandor imagines what it would be like if humans managed to colonize Mars. It adds in a collection of awesome sci-fi bubble houses, all connected by air-tight corridors and walkways. There's a super green communal space, so that your Sims can reminisce about earth, and four houses to live in.
An unfortunate result of the vampire’s never-ending thirst for blood is that they constantly prey on your nonvampire Sims. This means that they get quite insistent, constantly trying to get your Sims in discrete locations so they can suck their blood.
The introduction of Vampires, duels, and XP gains was a much-needed and welcomed addition to the Sims world. While the new features are expansive from previous versions, vampires still lack part of what makes them appealing: draining people dry. That missing aspect is what separates them from being the true night stalking creatures we know and love. The Vampires Can Kill Mood adds this option while also giving you the option to turn human Sims into cattle, which is basically a mindless blood bank for your vampire Sim to feed off of.
