## How to create a sims 4 mod folder

After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4 .. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled.. This mostly goes for people who don’t have folders within the Mods folder yet or have made folders, but there’s nothing in them.. Locate the downloaded files on your computer and then move the files manually to The Sims 4 Mods folder.. In the Mods folder, create a Mods Tutorial (any name will suffice) subfolder and move all of the “.package” files from the downloads folder into the Mods Tutorial folder.. will be stored in the “CAS” folder, Build/Buy CC should go in the “Build Buy Mods” folder, and so on.. Also, by putting newly downloaded mods in a separate folder, you can launch the game and decide whether or not you like the new mods you’ve downloaded.. If you’re having trouble finding the custom content you’ve downloaded, click the small arrow next to “Feminine,” click content, and check the box next to “Custom Content” so that the hair section shows only custom content you’ve downloaded.. One popular script mod is The Sims 4 MC Command Center Mod created by the user, Deaderpool.. We’ve already gone over how to turn on script mods, but where do you place the MC Command Center mod in the Mods folder?. First, make sure the modules and packages are placed into the same folder and that the folder is no more than one level deep in The Sims 4 mod folder structure.

or instead you can copy your mods folder to your desk top to make a copy and then delete the mods folder that is in your Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4. Do not delete the copy you put on your desktop or you will lose all of your mods and custom content.
Now you are able to go five sub-folders deep in your mods folder. I suggest that you keep all your mods on the top level and only use the sub-folders for your custom content. Many mods (especially those that are zipped) need to be on the top level. How you organize at this point is really up to you but I will show you how mine looks to give you an idea. I like to organize my folder by what it is and then the creator. So for example my path to a shoes by Madlen would look like this: C:\Users\****\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods\Custom Content\Clothing\Madlen
After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from.. Custom content and mods aren’t without their problems, so we heavily recommend organising your downloaded content well and creating subfolders that categorise the type of content you have downloaded, i.e hairstyles, clothing, objects etc.. Note that Script mods, which usually consist of several files, cannot be placed into subfolders, so we recommend creating a single folder for that Script Mod within the main Sims 4 mods folder, and placing all relevant files there.. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.. To check your custom content and mods have been installed correctly, you can view this in-game by pressing ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’, and clicking ‘View custom content’.. Downloaded objects will be viewable in Buy and Build Mode, which you can filter by custom content only by heading to ‘Filter Items’ on the right hand side, selecting ‘Content’, and then ticking ‘custom content’ from the drop down menu.. Modthesims.info : One of the biggest Sims 4 custom content sites that contains what feels like a bottomless pit of Sims 4 CC for you to explore.. We recommend using the tags #The Sims 4, #Sims 4 custom content, #TS4 CC and #Simblr to find custom content and creators.. Everything in The Sims 4 requires a mesh, so when downloading custom content that uses a new mesh, rather than an already existing mesh in the game, ensure that it is also downloaded or your items will not appear.

If your mods are not functioning properly in Sims 4, there are some free tools created by the modding community that will help you find and delete the files. The process can be tedious, but the best way is using Sims 4 Studio (a free tool for making custom content) and Sims 4 Tray Importer.
Got that renaming out of the way? Let’s take a look at your mods folder. I’m going to ask you to copy your mods folder to your desktop and then delete everything in it. Trust me. You’ve already backed up your entire Sims 4 folder and for extra measure, you’ve now backed up your mods folder. Double backup, no need to panic.
Open your “Saves Folder” located in your Sims 4 folder in your documents.. If you want one that isn’t, drag those things things back into your Sims 4 folder (not the original “Saves Folder” though, that will not be put back).. Copy everything there (including the scratch folder) and then paste all that into the folder that you made previously for this save.. Alt+tab out of your game, copy everything in your Sims 4 Saves Folder (including the scratch folder), paste it all into your folder that you named for this save (it should be a different folder from your one above).. Remember to every Sim week or so to save a copy of your current save to the folder that you created for it.. Now, delete the files in your Sims 4 Saves Folder (DO NOT TOUCH THAT SCRATCH FOLDER!).. Go to your base saves folder and copy/paste whichever one you want (the unpopulated one or the populated one) into your Sims 4 Saves Folder ( except the scratch folder ).. Alt+tab out of your game and go to your Sims 4 Saves Folder.. Copy/paste all of this into a folder that you make outside the Sims 4 folder for this save.. If you want to play a different save then you will make sure that you copy/pasted everything in your Sims 4 Saves Folder to your folder named for that save (remember each save grouping needs to be in a different folder).. Then you will delete everything in your Sims 4 Saves Folder (don’t you touch that scratch folder!).. Next go to the folder of the save you want to play (the latest save) and copy/paste all of that (except the scratch folder) into your Sims 4 Saves Folder.. Don’t forget to copy/paste the files from this save to your folder outside the Sims 4 folder that you created (every save grouping should have it’s own folder).. When you are swapping between saves, you shouldn’t need to do a thing to that scratch folder in your Sims 4 Saves Folder.
Before beginning the tidying up process, copy and paste your entire Sims 4 folder somewhere safe. My suggestion is a thumb drive dedicated strictly for Sims. Get the largest you can afford. A quick search of Amazon shows that a 128gig flash drive can be purchased for under $35 USD. Try to get an even bigger one, if you can. You should already be doing this on a regular basis of your important folders. These include your saves, tray, screenshots, and mods folders. Backing up ensures that you will not have a catastrophic loss of your important Sim documents later.

## What goes in a sims 4 mod folder

When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.
I wanted to talk to you about organizing your Sims 4 folders. I’m one of those people who likes everything nice and tidy, including my Sims 4 folders. So, I wanted to show you how I organize my folder. This will be done in multiple articles with the first one covering the mods folder.
I'm fairly new to Sims. And I recently found out about Mods and CC, but I have a decent understanding. I wanted to know more about organizing my folders within the "Mods" folder. I heard that you can only have one folder deep, but within which folder. So to better understand, let's say I wanted to download clothes, hair, etc. My folders would have to look like this: The Sims 4 Mods Clothes Creator (creator's name) or Type of Clothes. Am I far off, or close to right?I've been looking for someone who could explain in detail at a slow pace for me to understand, and sadly I'm still a little confused. I really want to learn and enjoy my game, and I don't want to mess anything up. Can someone suggest an easy way to organize and install these so they're easier to find later.
If you want to browse through some mods without having to visit and access a tonne of websites then we recommend taking a look at these sites that curate and host mods and custom content :. Mod The Sims hosts a huge amount of mods for The Sims 2, 3, and 4 .. Once you have the mod file downloaded it should be copied into the mods folder.. "Enable Custom Content and Mods" - This enables all custom content and non-script mods.. Every time a new patch is released it can break your mods and cause issues since mods alter the game code in the same way patches do.. The best way to ensure your mods are up to date is to check the page you got the mod from and look for either an update or confirmation that the mod is fine.
The mod folder is only the "finished product" so to speak, I have all the separate files in the same kind of folders elsewhere on my computer, it's where I save my files first and make changes and what not before I merge them and place them in my mods.
The Sims 4 has many unofficial mods and Custom Content that you can install to expand upon or improve gameplay, such as texture mods, new hairstyles and eye colors, custom houses, and more. This page teaches you everything you need to know about How to Install Mods in TS4 and where to find CC on PC and Mac.
It's not really that complicated. There are basically two types of mods, ones that change gameplay or add new features, and CC (custom content). CC is just things like new hair, clothing, furniture, objects that don't change how the game plays.Mods tend to break when the game is updated.CC "can" break with updates, but it's rare.Any mods ending in ".package" can go anywhere in your Mods folder. Up to 6 levels deep I think. According to @RandomBuzziness the default is "5" levels deep. Thanks!Any mods ending in ".ts4script" can only go 1 folder deep.If you download a mod and it's in a ZIP, RAR, 7Z, or anything else like that, you must extract it first before placing it in your Mods folder.How you organize it is up to you as long as you follow that. Although I would recommend not making it overly complicated as it would take a lot longer to go through it if you need to search for broken mods/cc... which does happen EVERY TIME the game updates.Tips:I would recommend keeping it simple. Like Mods\Clothing, Mods\Furniture, Mods\Hair, etc.Put gameplay mods together because those are more likely to break when the game updates.Most of my core mods that ALWAYS tend to break I put in Mods\CoreSome bigger mods like MCCC, WW have their own folders, same with LittleMsSam's. I have a LOT of hers, so she has her own.A lot of gameplay mods have version numbers in the file name but a lot don't. So, what I do, is if I put in a mod that doesn't have a version number in the filename, I just create an empty text file with the version number in the name. Text files are ignored by the game so it won't hurt anything. Plus it shows me the mod's version number so when I check for updates, I can easily see what the current version number is. When I update it, I just change the version number on the text file too.Like in Mods\Core, I have:UI_Cheats_Extension.packageUI_Cheats_Extension_Scripts.ts4scriptUI_Cheats_Extension_v1.17.0.txtThe third file does nothing but has the version number in the name. So, I can just look at the name and see what the current version I have is. Makes it a LOT easier for updating. I "Might" be able to just put the version number in the .package file name but some mods are particular about what their filenames are, so I just don't bother. An empty text file doesn't take up any disk space and it's ignored by the game, so, why not?Organize it however you want, but realistically, as long as "ts4script" files are only 1 folder deep, it doesn't matter at all how.But organizing it well will save you a LOT of time later on when you inevitably have to go through them all searching for broken mods.ThePsycho____________________________________________________________＊Accept as Solution button - If a post answers your question please let everyone know by hitting this button.＊Me Too button - 'Me Too' helps track how many players are also experiencing that issue.

This ensures you have an updated copy of your game (Sims families and your mods) should you have to reinstall the game. It takes time to build up a collection, and it’s a nuisance to lose progress just like losing any saved data for any other video game.
