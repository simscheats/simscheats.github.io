Sims 4 Hair Mod are an irreplaceable tool. So many new opportunities appear which enables you to use the resources much more effectively. But it’s better to take a look to the Sims 4 Hair, Hairstyles modhub free examples and see yourself.

By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.

Lastly, if none of these step’s help, you may want to look online for users with a similar issue. Head to Sims 4 or EA Games forums and search for threads dedicated to that specific trait and the term “mod not working.” Perhaps, the issue is well-known, and The Sims 4 community has already found a solution.
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
Another thing to check is the mod compatibility with your current Sims 4 game. We came across several different cases where the mod author didn’t update the existing version of the mod to be compatible with the latest version of Sims which caused the mod to conflict and not work as expected. Navigate to the official mod website and check if the current version of the mod which you have been using is working properly in Sims 4. You can also take a look at different forums.

## How to fix mods that aren't working.

Bad mods: If there are any corrupt or bad mods in your mods directory, there is a possibility that the entire batch of mods will not work. Here we have to apply a technique where we test each mod one by one to find the culprit and disregard it from the folder.
Every game has a cache folder which it uses for its operations and the running of the game. Since the cache files are created at runtime and may be leftover, there are chances that some of them get corrupt. When this occurs, the game causes unexpected behavior including the mods not working as required. In this solution, we will navigate to the cache folder and clear it.
Unlike the game itself, mods don't automatically update. When a mod breaks then you will need to check where you got it from to see if there's a new version. If there is, download it, and replace the original files. If there isn't, remove the files until there's an update.
Mod files in .zip format: The mod files which you download through the internet are in a zipped format. In order to properly place them in the correct location, you need to unzip them and then place the contents. If this isn’t the case, the mods will fail to work.
If the mod itself needs an update, make sure to leave a comment about it on its download page. However, if there is no issue with compatibility, try checking whether the mod package is unzipped. Depending on your PC operating system, the instructions for unzipping a folder differ slightly.
This is pretty simple to do. Make a new folder on your desktop and just call it "Test Mods" or something similar. Take half of the items you have in your Mods folder and paste them into this folder. Test your game and see if the problem persists. If not, you know the problem content is in that other batch of mods. If so, the trouble mod is still in your game, and you'll need to repeat the process again.
Hi, I have a problem, I followed all the steps, but when I download the mods and put them in the folder it still doesn't appear in the game, there is this window telling me about the mods that I downloaded but they still don't appear in the game... Can someone help me?
Note about Mod HelpDo not bother asking us for help with mod/cc issues. Go to the mod author on a forum/site they frequent or where they host their content. The mod author knows their work and can help you better than us, additionally they may appreciate bug reports!
