Pekesims fixes this issue by introducing the possibility of even more babies with this The Sims 4 pregnancy mod. Be warned, however, that raising this many children is going to be a major challenge, but at the same time, it really does make things a bit more interesting. For extreme family players only!
When playing The Sims 4 you can often be really bored with how pregnancy works, your sims don’t suffer enough, they aren’t living it super realistically and it’s just annoying. Downloading even just one of these sims 4 pregnancy mods you can completely change how you see pregnancy and enjoy the game. Happy playing!
Something that just isn’t realistic in the game is that you have the option to woohoo or to try for baby but IRL you really don’t have the choice of trying for baby or woohooing as every single woohoo experience can result in pregnancy. With a mod like risky woohoo your sims are going to have the potential to get pregnant from just a regular woohoo.
There's a surprising amount of restrictions when it comes to who can get pregnant in The Sims 4. While biologically it might make some sense, this is a game and players should be able to play out whatever scenarios they want. So, here, in the name of ultimate equality, is a mod that allows just about anyone to impregnate anyone!

Also yes, there are mods that allow male Sims to undergo pregnancy. There are way too many to tell which one is the best so just have a look in Google and pick your favorite from there. I’m just pointing this out in case you’re interested in installing one of those!
In the real world, pregnancy isn't easy for everyone to achieve. Some families try for years without success, while in The Sims 4, having a child can seem ridiculously easy. Thanks to the Cycle mod by NeonOcean, pregnancy in The Sims 4 becomes more realistic and challenging.
That is until this Sims 4 pregnancy mod by Tanja1986 was released. Through the power of science, anyone can now become pregnant if they so wish, which just takes away a ton of hassle from the game and makes romance gameplay so much more interesting and diverse for Simmers.
In fact, this mod is a large combination of many different mods, some of which we mentioned above. It serves as a go-to extension whenever you plan to start a new family in Sims 4. It really makes the whole pregnancy experience complete and real-life-like. The collection is done by a few brilliant creators at ModTheSims. And you can find more through the link below!

## How to get pregnant in sims 4 without a realistic pregnancy mod.

The quickest and easiest way to get a female Sim pregnant is by making her tour the Theater with her spouse/boyfriend. Once they are inside click the option "Try for Baby Backstage" and "WooHoo Backstage". There is the rare occasion of which the couple will be caught and thrown out. This is the best way to get your Sims pregnant because there is no flirting and kissing, so it doesn't take as long.[TS
While holding the object you just need that sim to click on another sim of any gender and choose impregnate and it will most likely work. Your sim won’t even have any genetic ties to the sim so you don’t have to feel guilty about having tons of kids running around.
To get a Sim pregnant, the two partners must "Try for Baby". When trying for a baby, there is a possibility that the Sim will not get pregnant, but if she does, the player will hear a lullaby song or jingle; signaling a successful conception.[TS[TS In The Sims 4, the lullaby song was removed, and Sims can use the pregnancy test on the toilet for a cost of §15.
In The Sims 3 and The Sims 4 (prior to Patch 34), young adults, adults, and male elders can try for a baby, but only female young adults and adults can get pregnant. Young adults that are pregnant and about to become adults will not age up until the baby is born.[TS Additionally, the chance of conception is lowered for older female Sims trying for a baby.[TS[TS With the release of patch 34 for The Sims 4, it is possible for a same-sex couple to have biological children without the use of mods or cheats. Sims can be set so that they are able to become pregnant or to make another Sim pregnant, regardless of gender.
Not at all pregnancies are obvious. In real life, surprises take place all the time, and it can make for really great storytelling to have that same aspect of surprise in your game as well. In past Sims games, this was very much the case, as there was no option to take a pregnancy test.
In The Sims 3, it is not possible for a pregnant Sim to lose the baby, without any cheats. In The Sims 3, if a Sim is impregnated or turns pregnant before becoming an elder, the process of aging is simply suspended until after the baby is born. It also appears that pregnant Sims in The Sims 3 cannot die, and will avoid or survive events that would normally result in death, even if those events are arranged by the player. Sims who have successfully conceived, but haven't realized they are pregnant, cannot die as well. There are many mods that will stop a pregnancy, however most of them don't have any negative effects on the Sim. If the player clicks on the pregnancy moodlet while pressing the Ctrl key with testingcheatsenabled on, it will not stop the pregnancy but simply deny the mother a happy moodlet during her entire pregnancy. If this happens to the "Baby Is Coming!" moodlet, the mother will remain pregnant but never give birth until the game is restarted.
There are many ways to play the game and you don't need to have Sim babies if you don't want to; however, if you plan on playing a legacy game in The Sims 4 with multiple generations of the same Sim family, you'll probably want to have your Sims trying for babies pretty regularly.
Say you want your Sim to have a baby that's their biological offspring, but don't want to wait three or four in-game days and deal with the hassle of pregnancy. The following cheat allows you to skip straight to labour once your Sim is confirmed pregnant (i.e. has the 'Eating for Two' moodlet).
