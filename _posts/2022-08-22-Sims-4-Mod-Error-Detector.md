## Sims 4 mod error detector

Have you tried the Mod Conflict Detector or TwistedMexi's Better Exceptions? I know MCD is old and no longer updated but it may still help figure out which mod is causing the problem. Better Exceptions is more current but shows different information from MCD. If you can't figure out which mod is causing the problem, it's at least worth a try. You may also want to download a Sims 4 mod manager so you can quickly enable and disable each individual mod to figure out what could be causing the error. I personally prefer the Sims 4 Ultimate Mod Manager. I hope this helps someone out there with the same questions.
