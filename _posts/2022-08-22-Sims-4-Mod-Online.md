Always one step ahead, the Sims community has already created a serious mod to bring multiplayer to The Sims 4. The Sims 4 Multiplayer mod is designed to let you play with other people in real-time on a local network. The mod basically uses one PC as a server, which allows two players to join the same game. It's still in closed beta, but the developer has a Patreon (opens in new tab) to support the project and hopes to expand the mod to allow more than two players in the future.
That’s everything you need to know about Sims 4 custom content. If you’re looking for general Sims 4 mods, we’ve got an excellent guide for that. We’ve also got a Sims 4 cheats list if you’re looking for some help running your sim’s lives. Failing that, why not read up on what we want from The Sims 5, should Maxis decide to give us another iteration.
While you can surely come across broken Sims 4 Multiplayer mods, this one has been written completely from scratch. Hence, it yields completely zero security vulnerabilities. If you do not trust the same, you can simply disconnect the PCs from the internet as you play on the LAN. There are many people who might claim that this particular mod is actually based on the existing code with security issues. However, it is confirmed that this Sims 4 Multiplayer is safe to work with.

In the base game of Sims 4, the only real “multiplayer” interaction you have is the Gallery, where you can download and add rooms, Sims and even whole lots designed by other players to your game world, which makes for a great feature for the Sims franchise, supporting player creativity.

## How to start a sims 4 mod online?

Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
When it comes to installing Sims 4 Multiplayer, it is crucial to have the save file prior to creating the all of the Sims. Further, you should ensure that the house is already built with all the important items bought prior to installation as the mod currently supports only the live mode. The buy and build mode for this multiplayer mod is currently in the experimental phase. Certain features could definitely work, but nothing is guaranteed. It is further important to house a save option with the time option paused.
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
How to installIt is necessary to already have a save file with all the Sims created, the house should be built, and all the necessary items should be bought beforehand since currently only Live mode is supported, build & buy mode are in experimental phase. (features might work but there is no guarantee) It is also important to have a save with time paused.
One of the PCs will act as a server and should do the following additional steps:1. Start the launcher2. Host a game by selecting an already created save file3. Start The Sims 4, load the save file, and enter your household4. You should see a notification verifying your game has successfully connected to the server.
Lean into it in The Sims 4! You’re in control here. Get started without the work when you download Lots and Sims from the Gallery, or create your own Sims who are just perfect for the story you have in mind. Guide them through character growth and life accomplishments, or get messy and watch the chaos unfold. The play you’ve been writing in secret? Act it out through your Sims. Start a career as a comedian or get into a fight without fear. Marry the love of your Sim's life after a single date. Have a kid with an alien! .
The other PC will act as remote client and should do the following additional steps:1. Start the launcher2. Join a game by entering the IP address of the host player (displayed in the launcher on the host machine)3. Start The Sims 4, load the save file, and enter your household4. You should see a notification verifying your game has successfully connected to the server.
All instructions regarding the mod should be found in the Frequently Asked Questions section of the main website, to make sure you are being directed to the most up to date and correct advice possible. I’ll refrain from writing installation instructions here myself for a similar reason; if the mod updates in the future, the instructions could become incorrect and thus detrimental to the correct installation of any mod.
