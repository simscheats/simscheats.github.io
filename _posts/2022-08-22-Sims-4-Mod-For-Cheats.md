To enable cheats in the Sims 4 open the cheats console by holding CTRL + SHIFT + C then typing testingcheats on into the cheats console. You should receive a message back that says “Cheats are enabled.” This will allow you to use any cheat code in the sims 4. Hold CTRL + SHIFT + C again to close the cheats console.
To enter cheat codes for The Sims 4 on a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, start by launching a new game or opening a saved game. Then, open the Cheat Console by holding down all four shoulder buttons while in game (or, if you’re using a mouse and keyboard with your console, press CTRL+Shift+C). This will bring up the cheat dialogue box.
Step 1 – Download the Tmex-AllCheats.ts4script (found on the bottom op the page)
Step 2 – Place it in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods
Step 3 – Enable mods in you game options (Gameplay options Other, and check both the “Enable Mods” and ” Enable Script Mods” options)
Step 4 – Restart your game (If the mod is loaded properly a popup will confirm it was loaded.)
Step 5 – You can now use every cheat from this page!
With the help of the Sims 4 CAS cheat in the game, you can personalize your Sims as per your requirements and make several other edits to the various entities available inside the game's world. Moreover, setting it up is pretty straightforward as well. Therefore make sure that you must give it a try.

And there you have it, a list of useful Sims 4 cheats to help you manipulate your tiny little virtual people in ways you’d never thought possible. We’ve got a list of games like Sims if you need more to scratch that simulation game itch, although maybe some god games will satisfy you.
And so, to enable cheats in The Sims 4, you must insert the “testingcheats true” or “testingcheats on” line in the dialogue bar. By pressing ENTER, you’ll receive a quick message informing you that codes are now enabled in your game. When that is done, you can proceed with adding the cheats that you want. Or you can SHIFT + CLICK on a Sim during your gameplay for some quick cheating.
Knowing how to turn on Sims 4 cheats and what they do once active will help you take total control over your game, so we're here to explain how everything works. With codes in The Sims 4 you can drastically modify many aspects of your virtual world, from where you can build and what items you can use, to the wants and needs of the individual Sims themselves. You can even change the UI, to make things less cluttered or get a fresh new look as you oversee everything. It's up to you how you use this great power, as you can make small tweaks to take the pressure off or go full on cheat mode and change everything.
To use any cheats in The Sims 4 you have to first enable cheats in the game and you do this with the testing cheats on cheat code. This is an annoying thing that many players simply forget to do in the moments before typing in their favourite cheat code. With Twisted Mexi’s next mod, Always Testing Cheats On, you’ll have testing cheats always on and it is awesome and helps you never forget to turn this on.

## Use cheat codes to get ahead in the game.

Many cheats require testing cheats to work. Ensure you've done testingcheats on first. This mainly works from the live/build/buy modes of the game as many do not work on the map. You should pause it by pressing tilde (`) or clicking the pause icon, and when the time comes will need to first press and hold the left CTRL key, then Shift, then C in that order, without letting go of any of the keys, to open the console in the first place. This should be a fluid motion and not too slow. Secondly, cheats must be typed exactly. You can get some help with testingcheats by following this link.
To use cheats, press Control + Shift + C to toggle the console on and off. You do this on Xbox or Playstation by pressing all four shoulder buttons simultaneously. Press enter after typing the cheat. For many cheats, you must also use testingcheats on or they will not work. Most cheats are used in live mode (F2).
First of all, if you are doing this for the first time, then you need to open the cheat console by pressing the combination of keys R1 R2 L1 and L2 altogether unless you see a command box on your screen that allows you to provide input. Make sure that all the buttons are being pressed together to be able to open this command box successfully.
Credit Where It's DueI've since learned to find cheats myself, but many of these cheats were originally found by TwistedMexi, who is now a modder that is known for his AllCheats and unique build-mode mods. If you want to see more detailed cheats than I have, look here. I won't publish those that players might infrequently use and don't want to put literally every cheat on this page as it's already quite long. Many are intended to be used by developers and can cause issues with gameplay if used irresponsibly.
One of the first things you might be compelled to do with Eco Lifestyle cheats is change your neighborhood's Eco Footprint. If you just can't stand starting out with an industrial neighborhood, use eco_footprint.set_eco_footprint_state [#] with one of these numbers:
If you want to turn off cheats and continue playing the game in the normal way, open up the command console once more. Now, you’ll have to type “testingcheats off” instead of “testingcheats on” and you’re done. Cheat usage will be disabled in your game and you can no longer use the extra benefits. Until you enable it again!
It can be very useful to know how you can advance in a certain profession when you’re stuck. Technically, there is only one cheat here that changes depending on the career you want to boost. Just exchange the last part with your chosen career. Below is a list of all available careers with their cheat codes.
First off, the steps are almost exactly the same as the ones provided for PC. The only difference is that instead of SHIFT + CTRL + C, you’ll have to use the COMMAND + CTRL + C combination of keys. The rest remains completely the same. This means that you’ll need to enable cheats first by inserting the same lines and then adding the rest of the cheats that you want. Pretty easy!
