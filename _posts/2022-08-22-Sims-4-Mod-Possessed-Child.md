## Aims of the mod:

Before I continue I want to lay out some very important facts: the VICE offices are open, meaning that everyone can see what I'm doing on my computer. Additionally, this week Rob Zacny and Patrick Klepek are visiting because they both love me so much. So as I've summoned a bunch of thots in my game of The Sims, Patrick came over to my desk to see how I'm doing. I told him that I'm doing fine, and explained the mod I'm using. Then Patrick asked me "what's that?"

My most popular mod was the Road to Fame mod [a mod in which your Sim becomes a professional singer or model]. But then EA released the official Fame expansion pack, so it kinda lost its luster a little bit. Now, it’s probably the Extreme Violence mod.
MC command center probably the most used mod by many. Bit of a jack of all trades. Since you can do so much with it (bump up the cap for how many sims are around on a lot, so getting inheritance when someone dies, have bills higher or lower) and is user friendly at that. Not to mention there's a step by step document to tell you what does what as well.https://deaderpool-mccc.com/#/releases
Fans of the realm of magic pack will love this one. The modular portal mod adds functional portals, which can be placed anywhere and on any lot. So if you were fed up with walking to the portal in Glimmerbrook or just want a magical finishing touch to your house, then this mod is an excellent choice.

My main question is what is the goal of the legacy challenge? Are you just creating a family having a kid and then that kid finds a spouse and continues on and on? Doesn’t seem like there’s enough to do which is probably why I never finish the legacy challenges. Shouldn’t there be a goal for each generation or something like that? Maybe I’m missing something but I can’t find anything in the rules.
Is it okay to ask more? What about trait changing LTR for founder? It’s likely been asked before but I have no idea how I’d go searching for that. I installed some mod traits that are not huge but could be fun to have. I’d probably end up slotting them into uni/social group trait space anyway but still.

When you go to Sacrificial’s website, you’ll find a page dedicated to listing the features of the Extreme Violence Mod. While it’s clearly not obvious in this article that I have any brain cells, I could definitely feel my last one sparking to life with each feature the website listed off.

## The mod's intention is to give players more control over their sims' emotions, turning them into sims with mental health disorders.

With this special mod, Sims can now propose to ghosts and eventually even marry them. No need for tears anymore, since with this mod Sims can basically stay together forever, even after death would normally do them apart. Morbid, but kind of cute and weird.
The point of this mod is murder and violence, and you've given the ability to kill and maim in a variety of over the top, gruesome ways. The most recent version of this mod added a new non-deadly interaction where a Sim can punch another Sim in the stomach. If the punched Sim is pregnant, they'll have a miscarriage.
The emotion system in The Sims 4 is pretty nice, but it can get a bit boring after a while when everyone's just passively enjoying their day and not trying to upset anyone. In reality, people are not as rational as Sims, which is what the Emotional Overcharge mod seeks to remedy.
There are two flavors of this new mod, one mod stops ALL Sims from using their phones constantly while doing other tasks while the other flavor stops all EXCEPT teen Sims from constantly using their phones. Both flavors have the added feature of stopping your Sims from randomly changing the color of their phones no matter what age group they’re in.
If you have the StrangerVille expansion pack installed, your Sims may suddenly become possessed. This buff instantly overrides all the other emotions. Players have limited control over possessed Sims. They will constantly ignore your instructions and engage in strange interactions instead. For example, they may wander around or talk about the “Mother” all the time.
Sometimes it's pretty frustrating how Sims get treated. It seems like life and everyone in town has it against them. Not anymore. Enough is enough, and with The Book of Chaos, Sims can finally unleash vengeance upon their enemies at full force thanks to the Torture and Chaos mod.
While many of these mods are actually brilliant additions to the game, there are a few that have us scratching our heads and wondering why anyone would ever come up with these. If you're looking to add some randomness into your game, take a look at these weird The Sims 4 mods that are guaranteed to entertain you.
This mod creates a new life state, zombie, and creates a zombie apocalypse, which your sim must survive effectively, turning the sims into a survival horror game. I have been keeping an eye on this mod since its initial release, but new resident evil features have been added in the latest version of this mod. So I will convince you to download this mod with the coming words ‘nemesis is in the sims’.
Famed for the numerous ways of murdering fellow Sims, the mod lets you live out your criminal wants and needs. The added murders range from running over Sims with a car, mowing down civilians with an Uzi, literally ripping out a Sims heart, and many, many more!

## Risks of the mod:

Mods are safe - until they aren't. It's something you have to be aware of for this game. The update cycle is so quick that you have to pay attention and make sure to update your mods every single time there is an update for the game. Because a mod that is not updated can break your save and running your save without mods active also has the potential to break your save. To me, it's not worth the trouble of going through all that. 1 or 2 mods is ok, but when you have to update 10+ every month, it becomes a daunting task.
Like others have said, if you are careful about what and where mods are definitely safe. I have 50-some mods in my game. I'm still running my years-old original save file with no issues and have never gotten a virus either. (Knock on wood! lol) I just make sure to check for updates before loading up my game.
As per usual when you download something, always do a virus scan on them. Always best to download mods from their sources and not any 3rd party sites (Simsdom, etc.)
I tend to not use super big mods that have a lot of gameplay (like Sacrifical's mods when there's a patch update they tend to break until updated or they just bug pretty bad cause they have so much going on).
I've seen a lot of creativity with the usage of mods. I have been hesitant to use them because I've had a lot of stuff hit my computer in the last few years with various things I thought were safe to use for different games & programs. If it's not ok for me to post this, please let me know. Can someone give me some guidelines on using mods? Any sites that are safe that have mods? Are they easy to install / use? Would I have to have the optimum protection to download and use them? I realize some would greatly enhance gameplay, I just don't want to destroy my fairly new computers. Thanks!!! (I'm using Sims 4)
Also not listed: Mods/CC by people who copy other people’s mods/CC, copy other companies’ copyrighted content or trademarks, pirate software or openly support software piracy, do not release free public updates within a reasonable time (3 weeks for CC), or are otherwise not in compliance with EA's policy on mods.
no mods allowed - account ban if caught. The flip side is you can create a mod which creates a better game. So then EA might want you to be be a part of their team, unlikely, or they ban you and take/use your idea and do whatever with it as it has no legal authorization.
It is perfectly safe to download mods and CC. Creators will not stick malware or viruses into their downloads. Creators create content for the game out of a genuine passion for The Sims; however, many creators host their downloads on sites that have pop-up ads.
The ranges are pretty large, and as is expected, things are bound to clip through if players choose to expand their Sims to the extreme widths and lengths. However, for a funny and weird The Sims 4 mods, it's a great choice and on the tamer side as well.
I would try dipping your toe in with a small mod that adds a feature you want or fixes something that annoys you. I'd suggest UI Cheats as a first step. While I agree with others that MC Command Center (MCCC) is a must-have mod, it can definitely be a lot for a first time mod user to handle.

## The mod could cause serious psychological harm to users.

If we detect players using this kind of mod content, they will no longer be able to play the game and will face permanent EA account bans. So that means anyone who plays with wicked whims will get banned. Anyone with wicked perversions, anyone with extreme violence.
Though the mod is completely not safe for work, videos of YouTubers playing their copies of the game with this mod still rack up views in the thousands. There’s definitely an appeal to it, especially seeing as the creator of the mod, Ahmed Qoqas, makes bank by creating violence-themed mods along with maintaining the Extreme Violence Mod.
We have a thread here on the forum that sort of explains the changes and the decision to remove it. I guess at some point Carl may get to writing a small section on this but tbh it really upset the community when the functionality was changed as the original set up was absolutely fantastic. I'll definitely pass on your thoughts to Carl. :)
Okay, I was trying to contain my love for Sacrificial mods, but clearly, I have failed since the next two entries on this list are both by Sacrificial. It’s always good to check out his mods if you are looking for new gameplay features, especially for wacky and out-there ideas.
This mod is a band-aid not a "proper fix": it simply helps you find the CC that you need to fix/remove and allows you to save your game. Note that the "groundhog day" bug is very likely caused by more than one underlying issue. This band-aid may help with it, but it may not fix the problem for all users as there may be something else going on that needs to be addressed.
Oh, how we’ve all wished our destructive spells were, well, more destructive. Now they can be. Incinerate your enemies with Inferniate, freeze their hearts solid with Chillo, and melt their brains with ZipZap. Whoever taught you magic never thought you’d use it to steal lives.
This is a new error that started occurring after the High School Years (1.90) game patch. At the moment it is not clear whether or not this is mod-related in origin or not, though personally I am leaning towards it being from a mod. Unfortunately, once the error occurs, it bakes itself into the save, and so removing mods alone will not fix it.
Whoops, I must have missed the question. We get a lot of comments here, so it’s difficult for me to see all of them. I’ll ask Pinstar about this. I would say, though, that as long as the entire lifespan remains the same length that this would be ok, but I am not 100% sure.
