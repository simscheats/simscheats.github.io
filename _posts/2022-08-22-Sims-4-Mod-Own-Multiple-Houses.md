## Create, play, and manage your own sims 4 mods.

Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.

The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience.

While waiting for any big, game-changing additions to arrive, it's a good idea to rely on some of the fantastic custom content that dedicated fans have made. Mods in particular can bring some much-needed spice to a game that might feel stale.

The past month, I've spent every day tinkering The Sims 4, making quality of life improvements, gameplay changes, and new difficulty settings for the game. If you'd like to learn more about my project, visit the post on Patreon where you can download it now.
Disabling Seasions But Keeping its Stuff - Want to disable weather or make plants in season year-round?

The Playable Pets mod makes the pets in the family household fully available for play. They can be controlled just like normal Sims, and even their needs are visible for the player. The Play and Affection meters basically replace Social and Fun, but otherwise it's very much the same.
Although sometimes it's kind of cool that The Sims 4 locks certain Build / Buy mode items and room layouts behind career track goals, it also takes a long time to get them all. So why not just have them all, right now? The Sims 4 BuildBuyMode Unlocker mod (opens in new tab) by scripthoge is a handy little thing that unlocks every item and pre-made room that was previously off-limits, meaning your house can be at its very best from the get go (with a little motherlode help, of course).

## Learn how to create mods for sims 4.

Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.
If you're fed up with your Sims having meaningless chit-chats with each other, then this mod from PolarBearSims (opens in new tab) could be just the ticket to spice up their interactions. This extensive mod introduces many changes, but one of the key features is removing idle chat from conversations. This means that instead of nattering, your Sims will have to interact with each other, and the mod will decide how this goes down based on the existing relationship between the Sims, plus their character traits and current mood. Sit back and watch how things pan out, but prepare for fireworks if two Sims don't get along.
A lot of Sims players will know the main cheat codes off by heart, and typing in 'motherlode' for a stack of simoleons is almost second nature. However, there are a ton of cheats available, and unless you plan on learning them all then looking them up can become a time-consuming process. That's where this mod from weerbesu (opens in new tab) comes it, as it adds all the cheat options directly into the UI without any typing required. Most efficient!
Not to worry, because the Life Decider mod brings in some much-needed randomness into the world of The Sims 4. Now, you can have this mod randomize a Sims' entire life, by picking their traits, their career and even their skills. There's no better way to make things more interesting than a mod that chooses for you.
When we moved from The Sims 3 to The Sims 4, one of the things that I missed the most (and there are a lot of things we all miss, of course) was the fact that the traits you could assign to your Sims decreased from six to three. But, thanks to this mod from chingyu1023 (opens in new tab) (based on the original from Embyr311 (opens in new tab), which hasn't been updated since 2016) that lets you add more Create a Sim traits, there's a way to get back to the standards that The Sims 3 set.
Gameplay aside, some of the changes the game needs have nothing to do with the actual lives of the Sims. In fact, one crucial tweak that Simmers need starts at the very beginning in the CAS screen, where players create their Sim for the very first time.
The Have Some Personality! Mod introduces a ton of small quality of life tweaks to make Sims' personalities more drastic. There are more special interactions, and romancing someone is more difficult at lower levels of affection. Even cats and dogs get some attention with this mod, as it gives them a nice personality boost.
