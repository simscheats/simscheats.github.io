Description:
Activating "The Sims 4" leads to errorMissing: C:\Users\$USERNAME$\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.
Depending on the language (on my side it's german) the directory is named differently.C:\Users\$USERNAME$\Documents\Electronic Arts\Die Sims 4\Mods would be the directory for the german installation for example.

## How to find the sims 4 mod nexus.

When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.
After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
The Sims 4 client will only go one-level deep when looking for script mods. In the screenshot above, you’ll see that the “McCmdCenter” file is in the very first level of the Mods folder. If you don’t do this correctly, script mods will not appear in your game.
Finding mods can be done in various ways found in the Files drop-down menu on the top of the site. From here you can browse the categories, new or newly updated files, top files, use the advanced search, search by tags, or browse the Files of the Month.
We have a system in place so users on Nexus Mods can request the addition of a new game entry to the site in order to help grow our modding community. If you would like to upload a mod for a game we do not yet host, you can still go through the mod upload process as usual and request the new game to be added.
Have you ever wondered how YouTube Simmers get their custom content—commonly referred to as “CC”—in their Sims 4 game? Electronic Arts never released an official tutorial on downloading CC in The Sims 4, and there are a lot of YouTube tutorials, but they can be vague.
the problem is that vortex searches for the documents folder of "the sims 4" but since ea decided folders also have to be translated it does not find it because in german the forlder is named "Die Sims 4" its still the same directory just the name is diffrent i expect this to only be an issue with ea games and a simple fix would be to let us change the mod directory
All the way back in August we launched the biggest giveaway in Nexus Mods history, in partnership with Republic of Gamers. It's taken a fair bit longer than I had initially hoped, but we are finally ready to announce the lucky winners of the RTX 3070TI, accessory bundles and - perhaps most importantly - the Nexus Mods mugs!
