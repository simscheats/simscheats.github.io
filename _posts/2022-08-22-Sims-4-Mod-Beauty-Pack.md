## Create custom hairstyles for sims 4.

If there's one thing in the whole Sims 4 game that needs custom content, it's the hairstyles. Many base game styles are boring or generic and the hair colors are even drabber. CC creators to the rescue once again with a vast array of different looks (and colors) to please any simmer craving diversity.

This hairstyle is one that both your male and female sims can try out. It’s cool and short, a bit messy, and I’m honestly loving the bangs to the side; very sassy! There are 24 swatches available, and the pack comes in two versions: with and without strands. This Sims 4 hair CC is compatible with the base game, which is always a plus! Try it out on your teens and adults alike. Here’s your download link.
This is a representation of the type of hairstyle every girl wanted at one point but couldn’t nail. And then we discovered hair mousse.

If you’ve been using custom content for some time, you’d probably be aware of all the little details that can make a huge difference while creating your next Sim. One of those details is using hair clips as an accessory. This can make the haircut pop, at least that’s what I’d like to think. We don’t have plenty of options though, so it was really cool finding this haircut. I also love the fact that this short hair has one side longer than the other; quite original. Here’s your download link.
This hairstyle is created by the amazing Raccoonium. Surprisingly, it works on males and females alike. Not certain you’ll want to use it on your male Sims but I would definitely consider it for my female characters. The sweet thing is, it’s compatible with split hair overlays. Meaning, your Sim could have this long hairstyle in two tones. Here’s your download link.

If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)

## Create custom makeup for sims 4.

If there's one cosmetic mod that makes The Sims 4 look better, it's custom makeup. Players can add amazing details to their sims such as birthmarks and scars for realism. Or to add pretty magical elements like Taty's Tribal Face Paint which would be a beautiful finishing touch to a fairy or mermaid sim.
Even makeup as simple as blush can change the features of a sim without having to remake them. While others like lipstick and eyeshadow can give a freshly polished look like Screaming Mustard's Glossy Lip Balm and Katverse's Phoebe Eyeshadow. Celebrate Halloween with your Sims with these bloody tears by Sims4Krampus.
