## Create your own sims 4 world with a mod.

All right, adding a custom worlds mod in Sims 4 is fairly easy. Creating one requires a lot of work, but not all people are suited for it. We recommend you to take a look at our personal choices, but also to scour the internet. If you find a save file with wonderful world edit that you like, then that’s what you add to your Sims 4. Good luck!

In The Sims 4, we have the total freedom to be ourselves. But what if we can’t truly be ourselves in one of the base-game worlds? What if our soul belongs somewhere else? Well, if that’s the case with you, then you aren’t completely out of luck! It’s totally possible to access custom worlds and load them like any other mod in The Sims 4.
The reason why the idea of custom worlds rivals even the best mod or CC pack is that it opens new opportunities in Sims 4. Just imagine an empty world where you can start everything from scratch! Or even better, imagine a world that’s already built especially for you, where everything is pretty and organized, and simply feels right. If that sounds tempting, then you, my friend, must take this journey with us and find the best custom worlds mod for The Sims 4!
What is interesting here is that these are all fanmade worlds that many Sims 4 players create. And because of that, you can find so many unique worlds, some of which you’ve never even dreamed of! The internet is full of such creations and you can find the ideal one for yourself. And if you want to check our favorite selection of Sims 4 custom worlds, check the mods in the list below!

hmmm like others told mod open world is nearlly impossible for moders, this meed a hardcode and cheat to change world structure, sims 4 worlds where developed totally different not only from the sims 3 but also sims 2 and maybe even sims 1, sims 4 worlds are not actually the whole world like previous games but the "neightbohood", each hood is a world itself, the white map with the world is like a fake map or like some old games where you click in a map and that part of the map is loaded, like old super mario games where when you complete a zone and move to ther you have the world map and in game you move you character to a new point of the world map and load it, sims 4 is somehow like that but unlike super mario you can't navegate trhough the map because he static and a fake image where you choose what 'world to load" each hood is a separated world or island swining in the nothing, none hoods are connected the world don't have any connection.
I know people can do a lot of amazing things with mods, so I was wondering can they make a mod for the Sims 4 that you can go through the open world without loading screens? I really don't mind the loading screens but it would be cool having the same open world like the Sims 3XD
Creator Arnie lost his job due to COVID-19 and spent his free time building Brookheights Open World, and the attention to detail is downright inspiring. This is an absolutely incredible The Sims 4 mod, and one that I'm very tempted to download right now. For all the information on Brookheights Open World, head here (opens in new tab).
And if you’re still wondering “How do I add custom worlds to my Sims 4?”, then be at ease. Custom worlds are custom content, or CC for short. This means that once you download them, you only need to paste them into your Sims 4 file destination. The process is the same for any other mod or CC, so if you’re having trouble figuring that out, check our in-depth guide!

## Modding for sims 4 – what you need to know.

The list of possible Sims 4 mods is basically endless. You can spend hours and hours looking through various websites, trying to find out whether a given mod is useful or just a waste of time. Over dozens of hours, we’ve tested a plethora of mods and hand-picked the ones most worthy of your attention. Through some trial and error, we’ve also listed which mods contradict each other and won’t function if both are installed at the same time.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience. Although the game is fun enough on its own (there's plenty of stuff you can do in The Sims 4 already), it gets even better when you're able to have more meaningful conversations, or fix the lag that's been bothering you. We selected some of the handiest, most entertaining, and most beautiful Sims 4 mods out there. Check the list to see which ones you like best, and you can install them right away!
With so many impressive Sims 4 mods out there, choosing the best ones is no easy task. Some of them fix common gameplay issues, while others add more depth to your Sims' stories. Whether you're looking for more cheats or just want to turn your Sims' world into a horror movie, there's something for everyone!
Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.
This has made the game tenfold more fun for me. Sims emotions are much less predictable and you have to work that much harder to figure out how to make them happy. The mod includes an in-game tutorial as well as an in-game setting menu that lets you pick and choose the features you want in your game. I would recommend first going through the in-game tutorial before customizing your settings menu to get a good feel for the things you do and don’t want in your game.
With the mod installed, you'll see a lot more options and choices at every stage of the child-rearing process in The Sims 4. For example, when you're talking about your Sim's infant, you'll have a lot more conversational topics to choose from. And when you interact with the bassinette, your options there will be enhanced as well.
From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.
