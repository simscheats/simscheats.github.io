This one is too cool to not mention. With this mod, your Sims can become super villains and destroy the world! Engage in epic battles against superheroes and embark upon a quest to become the greatest villain. Download it here for a unique Sims experience!
There really is a staggering range of custom content careers to choose from, with cat whisperer being one that sounds like fun. Or on a totally different path, you could pursue the 'ultimate' military career. Browse the vast selection on the Mod The Sims website and see what you fancy! Your Sims will be loving their new jobs in no time... probably.
“The Sims see you controlling a little society, but that doesn’t mean you’re making it better. It reminds me of Bruce Almighty, where the role of God is handed over but that doesn’t necessarily mean that’s strictly a good thing. It’s rather therapeutic just killing Sims, and being quite an irresponsible God,” RTGame says. “I feel like a kid with a magnifying glass on the small ants. It sounds quite twisted but it’s quite fun to do things like that in games like The Sims to see what happens. But yes, I do have a lot of Sims blood on my hands.”
You can also use it on NPC Sims, who'll receive all the same stuff - to decide their lives, you just need to use the bespoke social interaction which will be added by the mod. It'll take 10 in-game minutes for their new life to be generated - not long to wait for a full backstory and a fleshed-out life, then!

Using MorphMaker will require some technical know-how, but the mod's official page does link off to a few tutorials which should help you get to grips with it. If you're finding Create a Sim to be a little too limited for you, this mod will serve you well.
“When I was younger, The Sims was an escape,” the 26-year-old explains over Zoom. “I would make a lot of Sims that basically resembled me and they all lived the life I wanted. But as a YouTuber, doing the same type of content again and again gets boring to watch, so I went looking for challenges that forced me to play differently.”
My plan is to make a new sim and turn him into Werewolf.. I'll make a old looking home for him on that 30+30 Empty lot...maybe With a small garden, I want to slowly build him up to top to alpha I also know I want him to be in one of the packs but don't know what one....
He’s far from alone. While many in the Sims streaming community focus their content on cutesy legacy-style playthroughs or intricate design challenges, there’s an increasing interest in more boundary-pushing content. RTGame credits the popularity of his bizarre Sims series for helping him jump into streaming as a full-time career, while other YouTubers such as CallMeKevin and Plumbella count speed runs where they kill entire neighbourhoods among some of their most viewed content.

## Sacrificial mods make sims 4 more fun and interesting.

While fans will still have to wait and see what's in store next for The Sims 4, the best way to enjoy the game right now is to use some of the incredible custom content available. Mods especially can really change the way the game feels and how it's played, which is why these five additional mods deserve some love.
While waiting for any big, game-changing additions to arrive, it's a good idea to rely on some of the fantastic custom content that dedicated fans have made. Mods in particular can bring some much-needed spice to a game that might feel stale. For anyone new to modding or for those simply wanting to add something brand new into their game, here are 10 mods that will unexpectedly make The Sims even more addictive.
Not to worry, because the Life Decider mod brings in some much-needed randomness into the world of The Sims 4. Now, you can have this mod randomize a Sims' entire life, by picking their traits, their career and even their skills. There's no better way to make things more interesting than a mod that chooses for you.
Here's another fantastic mod that adds extra layers to the overall gameplay experience of The Sims 4. Developed by a creator named Roburky, Meaningful Stories redesigns the mood and emotions system of The Sims 4 to make your Sims' lives feel more important and interesting.
If you've ever thought that the parenting options in The Sims 4 are a little bit thin on the ground, this is most definitely a mod that you need to download. From a creator named Caradriel, Better Babies and Toddlers does exactly what it says on the tin – it makes major improvements in the baby and toddler department.
These changes don't just apply to adults, either. You'll notice that toddlers, cats and dogs also have more personality when this mod is installed, making the overall experience of The Sims 4 a lot more varied and interesting, especially when you're not in build mode.
The Have Some Personality! Mod introduces a ton of small quality of life tweaks to make Sims' personalities more drastic. There are more special interactions, and romancing someone is more difficult at lower levels of affection. Even cats and dogs get some attention with this mod, as it gives them a nice personality boost.
Coming to us from a creator named Weerbesu, The Sims 4 UI Cheats Extension is a totally ingenious idea. It's the kind of thing you could imagine the developers actively implementing in the base game, especially considering that cheats are already available in the game.
