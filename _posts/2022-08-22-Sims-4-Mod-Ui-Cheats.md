And when we say “cheats”, we often mean “money cheats”. The Sims 4 UI Cheats Extension mod is a popular way of solving your money problems forever in the game. It provides, what is in our opinion, the best money management that you can have in The Sims 4. Here is how it works!
This hassle of remembering hundreds of cheats in The Sims 4 is solved with the release of the UI Cheats Extension Mod. Now you won’t have to remember a bunch of cheats and write them down in an old fashion so you can use them whenever you want. You can modify anything like leveling up and earning money by clicking on it.
The UI Cheats Extension mod can be used in many different ways. The whole point of it is to make the gameplay faster, simpler, and better, for both new players and experienced simmers. Just imagine it for a second. You have complete freedom to change time, needs, careers, and what’s not right on the spot! This is a total game-changer to anyone who has been playing The Sims 4 for a while and has seen all the “annoying” parts.
There are several ways in which this Sims 4 UI cheats extension mod can be used. It makes your gameplay better, faster, and more straightforward and makes the gaming experience one of a kind for both seasonal and new players. Here's a quick rundown of reasons why you must have this UI cheats extension in your Sims 4 game:

## Allows you to cheat in the game using console commands.

It also allows you to gain negative money by setting the value to a negative number. The game has a security mechanism for this, and when it happens, it resets your fund to zero. Therefore if you ever want to start your game normally again, you must surely give it a try.
This mode allows you to do everything with a matter of clicks that can prove to be helpful in a variety of situations. For instance, let's say your sim needs to use the bathroom while taking part in a conversation; you can use this extension to make the bladder either half or full. This allows you to have complete control over your sim.
It works similar to pretty much any UI in the game and can be controlled by clicking on your desired option using a mouse. For example, if you want to control the time, you need to click on the clock icon located at the top bar, and it will allow you to modify the time of your game.
Sometimes there are objects that are hidden in the build / buy catalog, example: special in-game events that have ended, that you might want to access. To do this activate the cheat console, type in “bb.showhiddenobjects” and you’ll find the objects are now available to use.
For example, if you left-click on your money, you will automatically get 1000 simoleons. This is very handy when you quickly need some extra money to buy a thing or two. Sometimes only 500 simoleons separate us from the table or the chair we really want, so this is a nice quick fix to that problem. And you can also repeat this step indefinitely and keep piling that cash!
And that’s very helpful in a number of situations. For example, when your Sim’s bladder is low and they need to use the bathroom in the middle of an important conversation, you can just quickly drag it to full or half-full. This gives you full control over your Sim!
This function is great for solving glitches, or also just avoiding tasks that you don’t want to bother with. The same applies to almost any goal or similar function in the game, including event goals and holiday traditions. Right-click on any event goal (for parties, dates, and active careers) or holiday tradition to complete it on the spot.
This tool is beneficial if one sim is a caretaker for another pregnant sim. They will be able to do whatever it takes to ensure that their loved ones are never burdened with negative emotions, not even when they suffer an intense emotional event like the death of a family member!
