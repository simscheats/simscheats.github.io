Hi, my name is DmitryMalfatto. I’m from Russia.
Here’s my project, Mod Conflict Detector for The Sims 4. It’s a powerful GUI tool for detecting and solving mod conflicts in the game. Allows you to get rid of trouble-making mods, empty mods, mods for another games, or technically-not-even-mods, that got in the Mods folder by mistake. I’ve been developing this program since February 2015, and now it’s finally available not only in Russian, but in English as well!
The Sims 4 mod scanner is a reliable and useful tool, which gets based on GUI (Graphical User Interface). This interface gets used to identify some of the failing empty mods. The following pointers would tell you what the ts4 package conflict detector mod does or its main features:
2019 sims 4 mod conflict detector is available for Mac also. When you are playing Sims 4 mod in mac then you might have faced broken CC. To resolve broken CC from mac you need to remove all CC from the Mac Mods folder. Then you need to restart the game and see there, the game is load properly. This kind of CC problem occurs due to old mods files in the Mods folder. Like Sims 3 files.
The loading priority for the mod in the game plays an important role in the way the game tackles the conflicts in the game resources. As a result, you can use the Sims 4, Sims 3, or Sims 2 mod conflict detector for finding the CC that has been creating a conflict in the game.

## Detects and resolves mod conflicts.

Conflicts that occur among the Sims script mods cannot be identified as easily as other issues by the user. An exception to this issue is the core mods. The core mods tend to have a higher chance of experiencing conflicts with one another. So, make sure you refrain from using two various core mods in one single go unless the creator of the mod has informed you that doing so is safe. Before you know how to use the mod conflict detector, make sure you understand the script mods in detail.
So a mod conflict detector like you're looking for doesn't really exist, they generally just tell you if you have a script for the wrong game (like a ts3script instead of a ts4script). 50/50 is usually the recommended path. You don't have to do them one at a time, it's usually sections of mods at once, so when your game messes up or doesn't, you know which folder it's in before you go digging deeper into individual file testing.
This example illustrates the dangers of making changes willy-nilly when patching manually, and why this method is ultimately better at resolving conflicts that the automated merged-patch. The merged-patch will produce a nearly crash-free game very quickly, but some subtle features of mods will inevitably not work. By manually patching and understanding each change, we can solve for these conflicts to our own satisfaction. Whether you retain the essential flag or remove it, is a player-by-player personal decision for what you want form your gaming experience.
Identifying the conflict with the Tuning mods can be very easy. Mods (At least 2+) that tend to alter a minimum of 1 game resource possessing exact TGI can lead to game conflicts. The same is completely valid for almost all the override mods. As a result, if the mod is an override, it might conflict with other overrides designed to alter the very same resource.
Have you tried the Mod Conflict Detector or TwistedMexi's Better Exceptions? I know MCD is old and no longer updated but it may still help figure out which mod is causing the problem. Better Exceptions is more current but shows different information from MCD. If you can't figure out which mod is causing the problem, it's at least worth a try. You may also want to download a Sims 4 mod manager so you can quickly enable and disable each individual mod to figure out what could be causing the error. I personally prefer the Sims 4 Ultimate Mod Manager. I hope this helps someone out there with the same questions.
After the mods folder comes the overrides folder and the packages folder (given that you have installed and configured the Resource.cfg file in a proper manner). This is followed by the DCC cache Folder and next comes the rest files in the installation directory for the game. So one way to detect the mod conflicts in a faster way is to use the ts4 mod conflict detector.
@Suceress it only checks for mods that conflict with each other. If you are worried about broken Mods you can always check the category for Mods Bugs & Issues, there is usually a thread for the latest patch that lists broken mods/cc. @luthienrising hosts the threads and she is really great at keeping track of what Mods are broken and subsequently updated. The thread will also contain information on broken CC and whether or not you need to batch fix with Sims 4 Studio.
The FOIP (Fallout Interoperability Patch)was designed to merge changes made in MMM, FWE and XFO into merged patches that load last (after MMM, XFO, FWE, etc) and resolve all conflicts between them. However all that work can be lost if a mod that loads later has different flagging, which is why conflict detection is important for all mod users.
It’s not that hard to detect which mod is making the crash occur sometimes it affects particular aspects in the game. For an example if the game constantly crashes while you are trying to woohoo two sims then it could be a woohoo mod that is causing the issue. So in this type of situations try to remove the conflicting mod or check the mod creator’s website for an update.

## Protects your game from undetected mod conflicts.

Some conflicts are very apparent in-game such as in the example above, while others are hidden and only reveal themselves via crashes or when mods don't work right. In the worst case scenario the game will crash more often, sometimes constantly. These are the conflicts that we need to detect and resolve, while leaving the bulk of the good/intended conflicts and overrides left un-changed. We discuss the process in depth below.
I can't imagine playing without mods now. I use to play without any mods. I think my mods are worth the risk. I scan everything as soon as I download it. I go to good sites and I love playing with mods. If you decide to use mods make sure you keep them up to date especially after any major updates that Origins is quite fond of giving us. I would recommend Deaderpool's MC Command Center if you wanted to try out a good mod to see if you like it or not. I was hesitant at first but it was the first mod I ever installed and keeps me from trying to remember all the cheat codes for the game I use. I keep it up to date and love it. I have never had any troubles with this mod. It's worth I think.
@iEllaLouise said: I've never used Mods. Do they break your game? my friend just downloaded the serial killer mod and it messed up her game and she lost all her saves. I wanted to make my own post about this but apparently, I need to comment on more threads before making my own..? Please let me know is it really worth the risk? Also if it messes up my game I can uninstall and reinstall it right and that will reset my game to normal and without the mods?
Yes, the Sims 4 game is also designed to hide out the parts or actions of your sims 4 character that need to be censored. It can work in several situations to censor the body parts or action that might not be suitable for some users. Moreover, with use of the No Mosaic Sims 4 mod, you can cheat the game to remove the censorship.
When being used in the game play, some of your mods can get outdated due to the lack of updates. This can bring in a glitch to your overall gaming experience. The task of this corrupt cc finder is to look for these modules and avoid any crash during playing.

Problems due to the Orgin game client would cause the game to eventually crash. Make sure you keep the software up to date so this won’t happen. If you suspect that the game client is the cause of your game crash then a server issue could be suspected.
