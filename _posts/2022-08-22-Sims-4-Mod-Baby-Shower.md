Hey everyone! I've created a custom event type: Baby Shower! I thought I'd share it here, in case anyone was interested I made the entire mod from scratch with S4S, except the strings file (which I needed S4PE for). So thankful that we're able to edit the SimData files with S4S now.

Thanks for a great mod. I wanted to report a minor problem. If I host a baby shower for a sim in a different house, and i get the objective "Share big news" I can't complete it because I don't control the pregnant sim. I figured I'd mention this just in case you didn't already know.
Oh, I hadn't seen, you had posted this. I am glad you are getting on with the custom events and a baby shower is a nice normal addition to the existing range of events. Though new babies in my game will have to wait until the longer pregancy mod starts working properly again - aging turned off and three day pregnancies don't go well together. (Neither does the utter lack of toddlers, but oh well ... )
