## The sims 4 mod "realistic birth" allows players to experience childbirth in a more accurate and realistic way than ever before.

As its name suggests, Realistic Childbirth Mod increases the realism of childbirth in The Sims 4. Thanks to this mod they process will be depicted much closer to reality. Thanks to this three options of giving birth to a child will appear in the game:

The Sims 4 has received many mods across its lifespan. Some of them are so large that they practically completely change the selected gameplay element. One of such modifications is Realistic Childbirth Mod. In this guide you will find some useful information about it. Specifically, you will learn how to download and install it.
In The Sims 4, birth is lacking detailed features. This is even true after you purchase the Get Together pack that adds hospitals. Thankfully, a modder in the Sims community has made a realistic and in-depth mod for pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum care. Here's how to get it.
To sum it up, the Sims 4 has a lot of good gameplay – but the pregnancy and birthing interactions just are not it. At least not for us… For the Simmers who desire realism, however, the Sims 4 Realistic Birth Mod by PANDASAMA is the perfect option. By downloading this wonderful mod to your game, you get to experience a much more realistic and wholesome Sim pregnancy and birth! So, if that is something your Simmer heart desires, give it a try! You can download this wonderful mod here!
The Child Birth Mod by PandaSama is a realistic pregnancy and birth-giving mod for The Sims 4. It adds multiple components to the game's existing child delivery features (that requires the Get to Work expansion pack). Some of the features included in this mod are:

Another great addition to The Sims 4 that the realistic birth mod adds is players can now have other sims accompany their sim to the hospital. After players have selected a birthing method, they can invite a sim they have a close relationship with to accompany them to the hospital. This sim will arrive at the hospital and remain there during the labor process.
Now the goofy manner of childbirth makes sense given the game’s efforts to appeal to a younger audience but there are those who feel that realistic childbirth is nothing taboo at all and that kids don’t need to be sheltered from a natural part of life. If you’re a PC player who feels this way, you’ll be very interested to know there is a mod out there to bring a more realistic version of childbirth to The Sims 4.
