To even begin managing a restaurant in The Sims 4 Dine Out, you must first own one. This guide will teach you to build your own. First, know that unless you're cheating, building/placing one from manage worlds will not be a shortcut to ownership. You'd then need to pay the lot value to purchase the restaurant. So, if you've saved up some money from your Sim's careers or other money-making methods, you may want to start with what you have. I'd estimate you wanting a decent chunk of Simoleons (at minimum 12,000-15,000) before ever starting this process, because you will need to put funds into the restaurant to pay employees and cover expenses. If you just buy one that someone else has built, you'll need even more Simoleons because it's probably not built on a budget. So, I'll cover making one from scratch and the requirements to do so.
Learn from My Library. If you aren’t sure where to begin with your restaurant, you can head over to My Library for six gorgeous pre-made restaurants that are included with The Sims 4 Dine Out. Chez Llama will show you just how beautiful a restaurant can be, while Hogan’s Burger Bar pays homage to The Sims 3 and is the neighborhood’s burger hangout. Naturally, The Diving Pelican is a seaborne seafood restaurant that will show you how the tail wags the fish. If you need inspiration, we’ll get you started!
Alternatively, you can also search for the many wonderful restaurants made by Simmers on the Sims 4 Gallery. Simply use keywords and use the filters on the side for the correct lot top. Just check the description before you download a user-made restaurant. The icons below the build will show you what packs were used. You can download builds that use some packs you don’t own– but know that some content will be missing and you may need to fill it in yourself.
If you’re novel to Sims 4 and only acquire the base game, you will be disillusioned when you go out to dine. The Sims 4 base play has commune lots– such as health clubs, libraries, and even galleries – but not lunch places. To own, handle or even dine out at a restaurant, you’ll necessitate buying Sims 4: Dine Out. The fun pack allows anyone to take your Sims’ house to eat, and it will enable you to run your restaurants, amongst other features.

## Create and customize your restaurant.

Making Your Own RestaurantConsider your size needs and also that you might expand the building. You can own more than one restaurant, so you could start with a small diner and later sell it, only to build a bigger restaurant. Click in the bottom right corner of the screen and select, 'Buy a Restaurant'.
There are so many ways to tweak, add spice, re-arrange, and build your restaurant that… well, let’s stop talking and start explaining! We put together a list of ways you can customize a restaurant, and even a video showing what it's like to run your own. With these tips in-hand, you'll be able to improve overall star rating, leading to higher profit and success!
Pick the Aesthetic. If you’ve ever been to a restaurant review site, you know the setting and ambiance is a priority for restaurant goers. Get creative with your restaurant by making it a subterranean dungeon dining experience, or an outdoor garden, complete with a hedge maze. Put dining a few stories up to provide a view, or simply recreate your favorite hometown diner.
Just like with every business, it helps to start small and gradually move toward more ambitious goals. When running a restaurant, the player should start by adding easy-to-cook meals to the menu. Each meal that you can add has a set difficulty. If the menu contains meals that are difficult to cook, the chef can initially struggle with cooking them, and they won't taste as good which will negatively impact the restaurant's ratings.
When starting with the restaurant, it's best to pick meals with difficulty level one (out of five) which will help the chefs to do a good job. As the staff works longer for the restaurant, their skills improve, but the player can speed things up by sending the staff (waitress, chefs, hosts) to training which will help them become more efficient in their work faster. Also, to keep the employees happy, it's not a bad idea to give them a raise every once in a while. If their status falls down to very unsatisfied, it's time to give them a promotion so that they don't quit their jobs.
Running a restaurant is no easy task, but some seemingly little tricks can help a lot. If the owner has the time, they should use the category management to check in with the guests, interact with them, and make sure everything's alright. A lot of the guests come in larger groups, so it helps to put together several tables for the groups of three to six people.
But notice something about each of these presets: they all have drinks, appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Make sure your menu has at least one option for each category. A little variety ensures that people will stay interested, regardless of your theme. You may want to start with a more modest menu, however, and slowly add items as your restaurant earns acclaim. Then you can also raise prices– but only do so when your chef’s cooking level has improved.
Put your most high foot forward with producing an experience pleasant for food critics and visitors alike. Greet everybody that comes in to cause an inviting environment. Nevertheless, make sure you offer extra excellent servicing to critics– as their adventures are worth the best and will strike your restaurant’s evaluation the most.
