## Create and customize your sims 4 profile with cheat codes.

I use mods to quickly and easily cheat my sims needs. No more having to write out long cheat codes. With one click of a button, you can fill up your sim’s needs.

The following formulas are pretty self-explanatory. You’ll need to enter your Sim’s first and last name, as well as those of the Sim you want to get closer to. In the “amount” section, you’ll need to put any number up to +100. The same goes for all three codes. And that’s how to use The Sims 4 Modify Relationship cheat!
You can pick certain traits for your Sims during the Create-A-Sim process that control some of their preferences, habits, and how they react to other Sims. One way to cheat your Sims into having certain traits, especially those in the base game, is to use the Shift+Click cheats above to edit them in the CAS (Create-A-Sim) menu.
Just about every area of The Sims 4 can be amended or enhanced here, and we'll show you not only how to activate Sims 4 cheats, but also run through the best and most essential ones you need to open up all new ways to play. We've got Sims 4 money cheats to unlock your spending potential, Sims 4 skills and needs cheats to make your Sim everything they need or want to be, and Sims 4 item cheats to let you get everything you desire. And that's just the start, so check below for all the Sims 4 cheats you need and how to use them.
Change Traits and Appearance of SimsTo fully edit a Sim in Create-a-Sim, type cas.fulleditmode with Testing Cheats On. This will let you change the gender, traits, everything, and is much more powerful than the scaled down version you get without typing this cheat. Thanks Pokeh321 for giving me this information.

So, the CAS cheat lets us fully edit a Sim, from beginning to end. This means that you can change your Sim’s gender, age, looks, clothes, traits, and everything else, with no limitation! It’s a fantastic feature because it gives us full control over our own gameplay. It’s great for trying out new things with your Sims or for changing your family when you get bored of it.
Many simmers search for The Sims 4 Age Up cheats in particular. However, many aren’t aware that you can do the same thing with the CAS cheat! As mentioned above, when you enter the full edit CAS menu, you can set the age of your Sim to whatever you want. You can make an older Sim younger and a younger Sim older!
You absolutely NEED this mod if you are a player that cheats your sim’s needs a lot. To explain what this mod does in simplest terms, instead of having to type cheats codes into the cheats bar, you can visually click on things in the sims 4 UI (such as skills, needs, money, etc.) to alter them.
There are three different modes in The Sims 4: Create-a-Sim mode, Build mode, and Live mode. You can enter Build/Buy cheats in both Live mode or Build mode, but you must be in Build mode to use them. The Build mode cheats include codes for moving objects, expanding the Build/Buy catalog, and more.
