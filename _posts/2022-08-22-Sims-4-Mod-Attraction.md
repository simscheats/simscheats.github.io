Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
This handy mod by Weerbesu makes using Sims 4 cheats a breeze if you don't know the lot by heart. Right-clicking various parts of the normal Sims 4 interface will give you extra options for things like giving a household more money, promoting Sims in their careers, or changing the in-game time. You can find the full list of features by scrolling down a bit on the download page.
The Sims 4 has so much to do in the game. Between the base game and the additional Stuff Packs, Expansion Packs, and Game Packs that have been released to add even more content and more fun for players, it's basically impossible to get bored while enjoying a game of The Sims 4.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.

## Mods can add new features, make changes to the game world, or even change the appearance of your sims characters.

While this is a completely aesthetic mod, it's still definitely a fun and unique one that can change your gameplay up and make your game a lot more realistic. This mod will allow you to make your Sims taller or shorter, making it a lot more realistic than having everyone be the exact same height.
Once you're in game, you'll also need to enable mods in your game settings by going to your Options menu under the Other tab. Make sure to check off "Enable Custom Content and Mods" and "Script Mods Allowed" depending on what you've chosen to install. You'll need to restart your game afterwards.
The mod also introduces a new Reward Trait called Unique Appearance, which can influence your Sims' influences on others. Another way to make your Sim stand out is to have a rare or uncommon sense of styles (compared with the general population of a world) to create a more intense attraction for Sims with matching preferences.
This mod is one that changes the way Create a Sim works. While it's already possible to change just about everything about your Sim's physical appearance (including the size of their feet!), the one thing that we can't change is your Sim's height. Because of this, every Sim is the exact same height.
The have some personality please mod, created by Polarbearsims (patreon)gives your sims a bit better personality, involving things like no idle chat, and more things learned from deep conversations. You can also use this mod for things like risky woohoo and giving your sim extra autonomy.
With the mod installed, you'll see a lot more options and choices at every stage of the child-rearing process in The Sims 4. For example, when you're talking about your Sim's infant, you'll have a lot more conversational topics to choose from. And when you interact with the bassinette, your options there will be enhanced as well.
If you’re looking to change the game even more, have a proper dig into the Create a Sim ‘custom gender settings’ in the base game. They were updated a while back and now provide you with more options, such as the ability to allow same-sex couples to fall pregnant.
You can also use it on NPC Sims, who'll receive all the same stuff - to decide their lives, you just need to use the bespoke social interaction which will be added by the mod. It'll take 10 in-game minutes for their new life to be generated - not long to wait for a full backstory and a fleshed-out life, then!
