Introduction: The sims 4 never fails to add a bit of fantasy to the game, even though it’s a real-life simulation game. Maybe, because a bit of fantasy and magic is what makes things interesting, now, TS4 already had vampires and witches, but the creators decided to go an extra mile and added the gross-looking, terrifying, and flesh-eating zombies; in the sims 4 zombie apocalypse mod!

The Zombie Apocalypse Mod is the best mod in its category that we’ve played thus far! The fantastic creator has taken care of so many different things, and we love all the details in it.

Undead Sims will invade your world and start spreading a virus that infects the regular Sims and turns them into zombies. You will have to fight off this invasion and survive through dire times. Your Sims can either be survivors or become zombies and spread the virus even more. Recovering from a zombie and turning back into a human is possible as well, and you will have a lot of additional items that can help you endure. These include an anti-infection gas mask, gun and ammo, serums, first aid kits and much more!

In The Sims: Livin' Large, if a Sim or pet dies a loved one can plead to the Grim Reaper and engage in a rock-paper-scissors game for their life. If the Sim loses, but the Grim Reaper is in a good mood, he'll bring back the dead Sim or pet as a zombie. Zombies retain all of their skill points, but lose all their personality points and gain a green tint to their skin. Other than that, zombies function like normal Sims or pets in every way. Children can also become zombies.
Survivors are the “normal” Sims or the ones that haven’t been infected yet. If the survivor Sims are around the zombie Sims, they can get a “Terrified” moodlet. However, they can also use a shotgun or a handgun to kill the zombies. Plus, they get a lot of exciting perks to use against the undead.
Zombiism is introduced with The Sims 2: University, and also included with The Sims 2: FreeTime and The Sims 2: Apartment Life. In University, deceased Sims can be resurrected with the Paranormalcareer reward, the Resurrect-O-Nomitron. If a Sim bids between §998 and §4127 when using the Resurrect-O-Nomitron, the resurrection will fail and the Sim will be revived as a zombie. In FreeTime, a deceased Sim can become a zombie if another Sim makes a genie wish to resurrect them and the wish fails. In Apartment Life, the evil witchspellVivificus Zombiae will resurrect a dead Sim as a zombie. Babies, toddlers, and children cannot become zombies under any circumstances. Pets can become zombies, but their appearance and walk style does not change so this state is not readily apparent with them. Sims who died pregnant will eventually give birth to their baby, though it will always be normal.
