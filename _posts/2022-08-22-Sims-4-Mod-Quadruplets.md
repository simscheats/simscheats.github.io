## Allow sim players to create families with four children.

Pekesims fixes this issue by introducing the possibility of even more babies with this The Sims 4 pregnancy mod. Be warned, however, that raising this many children is going to be a major challenge, but at the same time, it really does make things a bit more interesting. For extreme family players only!

Now you can influence how many births they have at once. It may work up to 7, but keep in mind that the maximum household size is 8. So do a little addition, and save your game first. It may hang quite a bit generating all these babies. Use the Sim's ID you got from the first cheat, for example 1341302010235.
Note: We are not sure how many people are in your family, but if you have 8 or more members, then it's really hard to get a new sim even after practicing and trying for a baby. We mean, this is because Sims 4 only allows up to eight members of one household - so once someone moves out, you can try again!
What @Idiosyncratic53 said.MC Command Center has a setting to override household max settings as well, but it's very risky to play with more than 8 Sims because a lot of the in-game stuff isn't meant to handle it (CAS, split household and move, etc.). What I've heard--I haven't tried it but have friends who have, and have watched YouTubers do it--is that split household and move doesn't work at all, and that if you edit them in CAS Sims might just disappear out of your household. You probably want to edit them in MC CAS when they age up. When it comes time to move them out, you probably want to use the shift-click remove from family cheat and then hunt them down in households to put them where you want them to be.(On the other hand, if you don't want quadruplets, editing the family in CAS might give you twins instead?)Check those settings and make sure that maximum offspring count and maximum household size are set to what you want them to be.
The Sims 4 allows players to build any life they wish for their Sims. This includes everything from building the perfect Sims Cottagecore house to having as many babies per family as a player might want. While getting a Sim pregnant in the game is fairly easy, ensuring that the Sim will conceive two babies is much more difficult.

Well, this mod does exactly that for us! It allows our Sims to have quadruplets and quintuplets when they’re pregnant! In fact, this mod lets your Sim carry up to six babies in their belly and give them birth all at once. The extension has tons of options that help your gameplay with a pregnant Sim.
Tearing up limitations in The Sims 4 is what I always aspire to do, so this mod is a natural fit for me. And if you find the other mods on this list too large or not needed but you’d still like to have the freedom to choose which Sim will get pregnant in your game, I’d say download and install this mod!
Step 2: Force Offspring Count. In order for this part to work, the target Sim needs to already be confirmed to be pregnant with the 'Eating for Two' moodlet. With them as the active Sim, enter the cheat code Pregnancy.Force_Offspring_Count IDNumber #, replacing '#' with the number of babies you want them to have. This actually allows you to go beyond having triplets, if you want: you can choose any number up to your Sim's available household limit.
Having twins not enough for players? Maybe the idea of quadruplets or quintuplets sounds like a great challenge for a household, in which case the base game itself might make things a bit challenging, as it does limit the maximum amount of babies a Sim can be pregnant with.

## Allow for more complex relationships between sims.

You can sort of do this with Wicked Whims as it adds a customizable attraction system as well as personality “archetypes”. Sims who are attracted to each other and/or have similar personalities have an easier time getting along, whereas the opposite is true for sims that find each other unattractive and/or have clashing personalities.
Okay so, this one doesn’t necessarily improve romances–it does the exact opposite–because instead of letting sims get away with flirting and messing around with other sims, it provides real consequences for those who decide to stray from their relationship. Sims who are caught cheating can apologize, explain the situation, blame the other sim, and even blame their partner. Sims who were cheated on can confront their partner, confront the other sim, forgive their partner or instead fight them. Could you imagine? I can!
On top of those options, a variety of features dealing with relationships, preferences, and attractions have been added in, somewhat inspired by The Sims 2's attraction system. It's possible to have polyamorous relationships and even an open relationship with another Sim.
This is what adds depth to traits and personalities and what The Sims 4 is lacking. And there's no real way to fix this without rewriting most of the game's core functions. On top of that, emotions end up overriding and overpowering pretty much anything that makes Sims behavior like unique individuals.
If things keep going well, your Sims reach the make-or-break of their first love: they can ask to become their boyfriend/girlfriend. The two outcomes possible are success, in which they finally reach “First Love” level, or failure, which still allows an option to still be friends should they want to salvage what they had before. Touching, isn’t it? You can read more about it and find download links here.
Please excuse my strange English, but English is not my mother tongue. Where do I start? Well, I played Sims 2 yesterday for the first time in years and was overwhelmed by the complex personality system of the Sims. Every Sim really behaves very different from others, which is due to memories, personalities and aspirations. But also the complexity of the relationships between the Sims is simply enormous. If someone in the family cheats or gets divorced, it affects not only the relationship with the partner, but with all other Sims living in the household. Also the fact that children get angry if one parent kisses someone other than the other parent and the children see that. Although there is no such complex emotion system as in Sims 4, the emotions in Sims 2 seem to contribute much more to the gameplay. That shouldn't really be the case. In Sims 4 I cheated on my fiancé during the wedding, he saw that and the relationship was very little affected and the two got married quite happily anyway. In Sims 2 they just ran away at the wedding! Just for comparison...
I've found that the best way to make poly sims is to use the player trait but also, in the case of marriage with poly sims, you can use the cheat relationship.add_bit family_husband_wife on all of the people within the relationship so it registers them as married
@tsarakaMods:MC Command Center: The MC Woohoo module includes a "disable jealousy" option under MC Woohoo - Woohoo ReactionsWonderful Whims: You can give your Sims the "wonderful attribute" Polyamorous!No mods (does involve cheats):Base game: Control-shift-c to open the console, testing cheats on , and then Traits.equip_trait Player. If you want extra satisfaction points as well, instead turn on testing cheats and then set their aspiration to Serial Romantic and type Aspirations.Complete_Current_Milestone until the aspiration is achieved and the game gives you the Player reward trait. Do this for all the Sims you want to be in the relationship.Get Together: Press the U key to open the club interface (if you have Discover University it might show you university organizations instead, but there's a tab to show you clubs). Create a new club ("Polyamory club"?) and add the Sims you want to be involved. Add the club activity "Be romantic with" and choose for the target of that activty your club ("Polyamory club"?). I like to add banned action, "be mean" as well because that's the way I roll.Eco Lifestyle: Shift-click the mailbox and choose Instant Add NAP (cheat) and choose the Free Love NAP. Just be careful, if this is the only one you're using, to only be romantic at home because the no jealousy part only works in the neighborhood.
Ever wish your sims could expand their dating pool a little? See who else is out there besides the few sims that show up at the bar every night, or that one sim that seems to work at every food stall in every world every single day? Well, this mod’s got you covered. From blind dates to one-night-stands, your sim will have more options than they know what to do with. There’s even an add-on for Wicked Whims for those of you who want some really … really fun hook ups.

## Create families with quadruplets.

Ohmy I gotta tell you, it's hard work having quadruplets! By the time you tend to the 4th baby's needs, the first one starts crying again haha! The parents have no time for themselves at all. I think I need a butler, but they don't have the money for it atm T_T.
The quadruplets pictured were forced via the pregnancy cheats, proving they can work on a fully updated game, and when typed perfectly. The alien baby is a result of the male Sim having been pregnant before the save was loaded. He was already set by the game to have twins, but I knocked it back to 1 by cheating. So if your Sim has twins/triplets and you don't want that many, you can go back to a previous save and use the cheats to get only one baby.
In my current game I just had quads. Daddy is a family oriented sim and mommy dislikes children. Daddy has the surrounded by family ltw. So, we only need one more baby. I hate how their genetic mixed in the kids QED can only hope for better with the third generation.
OK, so there's no official way to ensure that you get the number of babies you want. There's certainly no easy way to do it, even with cheats. However, if you're really dedicated to the idea of massively numbered offspring, the following sequence can help you to force the outcome:
However, these odds are still much better than the 1% base chance of having triplets randomly. If you want to focus on getting this achievement, choose a Sim family and begin by applying the 'Fertile' reward trait to both prospective parents. Then, depending on what expansions you have installed, you can make use of the 'On Ley-Line' lot trait, Elixir of Fertility, and Fertility Massage to further boost your chances of success.
Though it is possible to influence the game to give you Twins or Triplets, the pregnancy will typically produce a single baby. Twins and triplets can happen naturally, but to increase the chances of twins or triplets, use the Fertile Reward. It's available from the Rewards Store for the price of 3,000 Satisfaction points. You can also cheat to have twins or triplets, see below. If those cheats are too complex, you can use the Sims.give_satisfaction_points X cheat to give yourself enough to afford fertile
Hey guys, my sim just gave birth to 4?!?!?!? babies omg. This has never happened to me before, has anyone of you ever gotten quadruplets? I don't know if this is because of a mod because in all my sims years this has never happened o-o. I do have Awesomemod and some NRAAS mods like SP but Ive had those for 3 years already and never had quadruplets before o-o
I Had issues with this.. But if you save it, go out to menu, come back in.. and follow the instructions above it works, personally i went for 5 Babies, quick way to fill up the last spaces in my family, only issue i had tho.. ( i tried 6 times before i finally gave up).. was the fact that it always came out 4 boys nd a girl.. :\ i already had a boy.. and id have liked more girls.. but still glad it worked.
