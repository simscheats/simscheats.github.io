title: "Sims 4 Mod Constructor Programming Error"

## Sims 4 mod constructor is poorly coded and causes programming errors.

The issue is due to the UI not understanding 64-bit trait IDs, and the solution is to use 32-bit IDs instead. Unfortunately, this has the side effect of breaking compatibility with existing saved games and saved Sims in your library. If you already have Sims with custom traits, they will lose them and you’ll have to re-apply them. There’s nothing I can do to fix this.

Introducing THE SIMS 4 MOD CONSTRUCTOR V5! This is not just an update, but a whole new fifth version that makes creating mods easier than ever! You can download an early alpha from GitHub. It supports traits, social interactions and custom whims! https://github.com/Zerbu/Mod-Cons
This post will cover the basics and getting started with The Sims 4 Mod Constructor by Zerub. This program can be used as sole source when creating mods such as traits, careers, aspirations, social events, and much more, or it can be the base you build on to if it feels too limiting.
Zerbu's Mod Constructor V4 is a powerful tool for Sims 4 that can be used to create custom traits for Sims in CAS, lot traits, aspirations and more. In this video tutorial, I'll be walking you through very basic trait creation for Sims (or cats, or dogs - you have the power!) with step-by-step instructions:
This is probably a dumb question, but I’m using Zerbu’s mod constructor to make some custom traits and social interactions, but when I load them into my game, it all works fine until I get to build mode. Somehow my custom traits are crashing build mode and I don’t understand how it’s connected. And I checked, it is my mod causing the problem, not something else. If anyone has any idea what’s happening, tips would really be appreciated.

Part 9 of our modding series explores using Sims 4 Studio to create CAS Overrides to either hide certain CAS items from appearing on Sims at random or appearing in CAS at all. Make sims wear age appropriate hair and clothing and banish certain hated CAS items for good!
@jpkarlsenZerbu's mod constructor isn't a mod, it is a program to create mods like custom buffs, traits, careers, and such. They were using it to create their own mod.@bellagoth21 This is probably not the best place to ask about that. Mods aren't really supported or discussed in that detail here.Try asking about it here: https://forums.thesims.com/en_US/categories/tutorials-and-tools-ThePsycho____________________________________________________________＊Accept as Solution button - If a post answers your question please let everyone know by hitting this button.＊Me Too button - 'Me Too' helps track how many players are also experiencing that issue.
