## Sims 4 mod folder not working

@LottieGrayYT That's not the Sims 4 folder where you need to add mods. As the original instructions say, the correct folder is in Documents\Electronic Arts. Be sure to start your game at least once, so that this Sims 4 folder will be created.And please remove the Mods folder you created from the Sims 4 folder in Program files (x86). That data doesn't belong there and can only cause problems.

@ThisIsMePlayingI'm sure the game has created a new mods folder in your game. Maybe you're looking in the wrong place. . The game is installed in two folders, One folder is in Program files and this should not be touched. Second folder is in Dokuments / Electronic Arts / The Sims4 and there must be a new mods folder in the game folder.I don't work for EA
We have received numerous reports regarding the issue where Sims 4 mods fail to work. Either the game doesn’t pick up the mod files which you have pasted in the directory or the mod fails to initialize. We looked at several user reports and use cases to come to the conclusion that this issue occurred due to several different reasons.
@AritistyX To create a new mods folder: In your The Sims 4 folder, located in DocumentsElectronic Arts; you will find a folder called Mods. Delete it/move it somewhere else if you want to save what is in it; and start the game. It is enough to go to Main Menu, (and then exit). A new folder called Mods will be generated, and you can paste/download your mods into it.A tip is to create your own thread for any issues you have, and describe them in detail.
Another thing to check is the mod compatibility with your current Sims 4 game. We came across several different cases where the mod author didn’t update the existing version of the mod to be compatible with the latest version of Sims which caused the mod to conflict and not work as expected. Navigate to the official mod website and check if the current version of the mod which you have been using is working properly in Sims 4. You can also take a look at different forums.

@LottieGrayYT There are two sets of files for the game: the program files are where you installed them, common path is the one you mentioned: C:\Program Files (86)\Origin Games.The user files are located in DocumentsElectronic Arts in a folder called The Sims 4. Inside that folder is a folder called Mods, this is where you install your mods and CC.Detailed tutorial:https://www.carls-sims-4-guide.com/tutorials/mods-cc.phpI would suggest you delete the mods folder you put in with the program files, and do a Repair in Origin for good measure:OriginMy Game Library right click The Sims 4 icon, choose Repair in the drop-down menu.Then install your mods in the right folder.
so ive noticed that a lot of people are having this problem but i haven't seen anyone with an answer. my mods were a OK a while ago. I've been trying to fix this for two days with no luck. so my mods folder is in my sims 4 folder which is in my ea folder. i have had ZERO problems up until a few days ago. I've deleted everything and uninstalled the game and then re downloaded mods and cc and the game as well. Scripts and cc ARE enabled and in my mods folder. but the game wont register them. if someone can please help me that would be great but if not i think im quitting the sims.
I have a problem too with my mods folder. Yesterday I bought the sims 4 base game with the cats and dogs expansion pack , the location of mine sims 4 folder is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games and when i open it , it didnt have mods folder i made one and then i put my mods and cc the cc and mods that i have inside dont show up in my game and i have inside the mods folder the resource.cfg file but still they dont show up in my game . What can I do ? Do I need to buy all the packs ?
@itsmaayyaa It could be that some of those .script mods are obsolete. Obsolete mods can definitely cause problems with your game and even ruin game saves. We'll have to deal with those later as first we need to get your game running again without any mods or CC.Please try the following in this exact order without skipping any steps, even if you’ve done some of these steps already:Make a copy of your entire The Sims 4 folder in Documents/Electronic Arts to an external drive or a temp folder somewhere else in your Documents folder. This part is very important because this is your backup for your Save and Tray files for if anything goes wrong. Keep it in a safe place that you will remember where it is and don't make any changes to it for now.In your Electronic Arts/The Sims 4 folder temporarily move your Mods folder onto your desktop and delete the localthumbcache.package file. Also delete any other folders in the The Sims 4 folder with word "cache" in the name. Don't restart your game yet, but when we get to that part the game will automatically create a new Mods folder and auto-generate a new localthumbcache file. The new Mods folder will be empty but no worries you can bring everything back in later.Repair your game through Origin [ Open Origin, click 'My Game Library' then right-click The Sims 4 icon and select Repair ]. Make sure to let it run until it has completed all repairs (it will do the base-game first, then run through each of your expansions/packs). This might take a few minutes depending on your computer and how many packs you have but let it go until it finishes.Do not re-add any of your Mods or CC at this time.Start your game and select New Game and see if everything looks to be running ok without mods or CC. Make a new household, play around a bit. This is just for a test, if everything looks good you can exit without saving (you can try to play your old saves later, for now we are just trying to get your game to work).Before re-adding any of your mods, please check the mod creators' websites to see if there are any updated versions or at least a verification that the older mods are still compatible with the latest game patch. Follow any special instructions they provide on how to install their mods. I use Mod Trackers like the one at Simsonic Sims 4 to check the statuses of all the mods I use in my game.https://simsonic.weebly.com/modtracker.htmlLet us know how all this works out. Good luck I hope this helps :D

## Sims 4 not finding mods

Finally, uninstalling and reinstalling the Sims 4 is the last resort to fix mods notworking problem. You can completely remove the Sims 4 from your computer and then download the latest version of the game from the official website. Then, install the game according to the given instruction and check if Sims 4 mods not showing up issue is removed.
In Sims 4, an option is provided to allow players to enable or disable the mods in game according to their needs. If this option is disabled, you will definitely experience Sims 4 mods not showing up issue. So, you should firstly check if mods are enabled in your Sims 4. To do that, you need to:
In this case, you should create a new household and check if it can load the mods. If Sims 4 mods not working issue disappear, it will be sure that this issue is caused by the household problem. You can give up the original household and use the new one.
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
@Queen_Mia1228 Do you run the standard version of Sims 4, or the Legacy Edition? If you have the standard version, you'll need to make sure your mods are fully updated for the current patch. If you have the LE, you'll need to specifically download mods made for or confirmed to be compatible with the LE; the newer ones won't work.
Like mentioned before, Sims 4 rolled out an update where users were given an option in-game which allowed them to enable/disable the mods. Previously, this wasn’t the case and the game would automatically load all the mods as long as they were in the mods folder. In this solution, we will navigate to the in-game options and make sure that the option is enabled.
Lastly, if none of these step’s help, you may want to look online for users with a similar issue. Head to Sims 4 or EA Games forums and search for threads dedicated to that specific trait and the term “mod not working.” Perhaps, the issue is well-known, and The Sims 4 community has already found a solution.
If your mods won’t work after installing the latest Sims 4 updates, make sure to update them to the latest version and unzip your mod packages. Then, clear your game cache and repair your Sims 4 game files. Check if your mod list includes a faulty mod and delete it. You can also create a new household and reinstall the game.
