## Create a custom sims 4 mod and explore the world of life.

With a plethora of mod types to make your Sims 4 game more interesting and closer to realism, it’s simply hard to decide what works for you and what doesn’t. However, there is a new mod available in the market to make your decision-making process much easier. This is the Slice of Life Mod for Sims 4 game. This particular module has been designed to focus on the addition of more realism within the game. With this mod, you can add several physical changes to the Sims based upon the new buffs, mood, as well as the cellphone menu that is pretty similar to that of Sims 4 Social Media Mod.

Once you have placed the files in the mod folder, go to your game and enable the Slice of life Sims 4 mod. When this is done, shut down the game and restart the same to ensure the mod is properly set to work. In case the mod doesn’t work, there might be a chance that your mod isn’t in sync with the updated game. To fail-proof this issue, you need to download the latest patch and make sure you have deleted the earlier version to ensure compatibility.

## Create a sims 4 mod and explore the world of death.

Death in The Sims 4 is pretty bizarre. After an incident takes place or when a Sim reaches old age, they will collapse on the ground and everyone will gather around to mourn them. Meanwhile, the Grim Reaper makes his entrance, and family and friends can try to plead for their loved one.
Look away now if you’re not a big fan of violence, you have been warned! This mod is great for creating serial killer Sims that will autonomously kill other Sims. Players can easily adjust the settings and such to their preferences. Anything can become a weapon… even the booty.
For the fans of chaos, this one's for you! This mod unleashes 5 serial killer townies into your game. Each of these dangerous NPCs will have their own dialogue and can murder any Sim they want. If you ever decide to invite one of them over, be sure your Sim has the cops on speed dial!
How to prevent illnesses?Some can’t completely be prevented (example: allergies) but if you have good hygiene, keep your hands clean, eat in clean places, stay away from sick sims, etc…you should be fine and if a sim around you has the flu then keep good hygiene and stay away from them to prevent getting it.
If you do not need the add-on features of the mod, such as the social system or memory system, it can easily be deleted. However, you need to keep in mind that the file named “KS – SOL MainSystem.package” should in no way be deleted as it is a critical part of the mod.
