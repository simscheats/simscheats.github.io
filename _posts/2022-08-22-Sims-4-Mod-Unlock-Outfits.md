So if you’re wondering how to unlock all items in The Sims 4, then you’ve found the right guide because we are going to show you exactly what to do.
Cheat codes are a major part of Sims 4 and the only way to unlock all the objects in the game. If you’ve played the game for a while, chances are, you already have the cheat console activated.

## Sims 4 mods can unlock costumes for your sims.

Work clothing can be a huge problem in Sims 4, but using cheat codes and mods is a great way to solve it. They allow you to change the attire of your Sims and NPCs within minutes to make it more suitable to their occupations. Thus, you can create a perfectly dressed workforce regardless of your platform.
Switching up work clothing in Sims 4 can be tricky, as the game itself doesn’t allow this feature. Luckily, you can use a cheat code to overcome this obstacle called “Change Career Outfit.” It enables you to implement all your attire ideas to make your Sims’ career more attractive.
Another way to change your Sims’ work outfit is to use a mod called “Plan Career Outfit.” The mod adds interactions to all dressers, Get Together closets, and mirrors. It can also be incorporated into any object that already features the Change Sim interactions, meaning it’ll automatically work with Custom Content creations.
Can’t you manage to get your Sims into life-threatening situations? With the Cheats from this List you can turn your Sims directly into Ghosts! They get a color matching the Death Type and cause environmental effects: For example, drowned Sims leave puddles of water wherever they move.
