## How to install sims 4 mods on mac.

Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.

Another factor that you need to keep in mind is that the system requirements might change depending on the updates provided for the mod. With the Sims 4 mod installer, you can ensure that all your mods are in sync with the system requirements. If there is a mod that isn’t in sync, it will be removed or sorted out.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
With the previous versions of Sims 4 Mod Organizer or Manager, the installation of package mods first required you to extract “Package” files from somewhere & add them alongside the mod organizer. However, in the latest version of the TS4MM or The Sims 4 Mod Manager, this particular step has been removed. If the mods or package mods downloaded by you are contained inside the “.rar”, “.zip”, or “.7z” archive, one can simply drag the same into the manager and add the same with a button.
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.

Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
Go to your Mods folder and right-click it. Again, copy it to your Desktop. Once you're sure you have a copy of your Mods folder on your Desktop, go ahead and delete the copy in your Sims 4 folder. Restart your game and play it for a few minutes. If your game runs without crashing or having errors, you know the issue is with one of your Mods. If it doesn't, you'll need to go out and repair your game (and the issue is something within your Sims 4 game itself).
Remember that game mods and custom content are designed to work with genuine versions of The Sims 4. There is no guarantee that they will work with pirated versions of the game, so if you do have a pirated version and a mod isn't working, that could be why. The only way to fix this would be to buy a copy of The Sims 4 directly from Origin, where you can ensure the game will be patched regularly and compatible with all mods and custom content.
If anyone can help me…I just downloaded sims 4.i have downloaded a couple pieces of mods.i have a macbook air.and the mod is already unzipped.when I try to go in my mods folder it wont let me place anything in it and the resource.cfg file is all greyed out…what do I do???

## How to use the sims 4 mod manager mac.

And if you click on the furthermost tool in the same corner, the one labeled Open The Sims 4 “Mods” folder, you will be directed to the destination of your installed mod. Notice that if a mod isn’t checked/selected in the main list on the Mod Manger, then it won’t be shown in the folder either.
Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
After you install the program, the main framework that you’ll be using in it is called Manage Mods. If you click on it, an empty page will open up. Since you have just now installed it for the first time, you will need to import all of your mods and CC. That’s easily done through the little plus “+” button at the bottom left corner. But be aware that sometimes the program links to your Sims 4 folder, and if you already have mods and CC loaded to the game, they might appear on the page.
If you ask why, then you’re on the right track to make your life a lot easier. You see, the Mod Manager is a quality of life, fully developed software that helps you organize all The Sims 4 files. If you’ve ever found yourself in the mess of all the additional mods and CC you download for the game, then this is your ticket out of that hell!
To download the Sims 4 TOOL mod by TwistedMexi, you'll first need to find the mod page on her Patreon. Normally, you have to be a paying patron on Patreon to access creator posts, but TwistedMexi has listed this mod for public use, so you don't need to pay anything here. Follow these steps to download the mod:
The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
Identifying the problematic mod can be as easy as deleting the last mod you've downloaded, if the problem cropped up after that. Paste your Mods folder back into your Sims 4 folder and then sort your files by Date Modified. Delete the most recent mod/CC and restart your game, play for a few minutes and see if your game works. If so, you've found the problem mod.
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
