## Better babies is a mod for the sims 4 that changes some of the game's features to make childbirth more pleasant.

Another great addition to The Sims 4 that the realistic birth mod adds is players can now have other sims accompany their sim to the hospital. After players have selected a birthing method, they can invite a sim they have a close relationship with to accompany them to the hospital. This sim will arrive at the hospital and remain there during the labor process.

The Sims 4 has made quite a few things that have been brought to the franchise by older games better. Vampires, social interactions, and the experience of going to university are a few things that The Sims 4 does better than previous. Unfortunately, babies and pregnancy are a bit of a lackluster feature in The Sims 4
, even years after the game's release. Aside from a few special interactions and mood buffs, it's easier to just fast-forward through the pregnancy (and baby) stage.

Many Simmers hope that one day EA might come back and expand upon pregnancy and babies, but for now here are 10 of the best pregnancy mods currently out to spice up parenthood gameplay.
Updated on February 12th, 2020 by Anastasia Maillot: With talk of The Sims 5 surfacing, the franchise could be bringing back better pregnancies and more immersive babies in its next installment for the game. However, as we wait for more information, custom content is the best way to expand on pregnancy.In hopes of one day seeing better pregnancy mechanics in The Sims 5, we've chosen three additional mods to present, which will significantly improve any Simmer's pregnancy gameplay experience.
Babies play a big role in Sims 4. They’re the center of every family in the game and you often spend much of your time and energy on them. But what if you can improve your overall experience? Well, that’s totally possible with the best baby mods and CC for Sims 4!
Scumbumbo has also made some amazing changes to how we raise our babies in Sims 4. With this mod, your adult Sims will definitely spend a lot more time with the baby, making intelligent decisions about how to calm it, when to feed it, and everything else in between.
As you can see from that list (and that doesn’t even include the add-ons!), this pregnancy mod will COMPLETELY change your game. It adds so much depth, realism, and excitement when creating a family in the sims 4. I mean think of all the storylines you can create from surrogacy to co-parenting to adoption!

Pregnancy definitely doesn't look the same on everyone, and the way EA designed it seems a bit cartoonish at times. LittleMsSam's pregnancy mod for The Sims 4, Pregnancy Overhaul, introduces a much more toned-down version of the appearance and animations of pregnant Sims.
Pekesims fixes this issue by introducing the possibility of even more babies with this The Sims 4 pregnancy mod. Be warned, however, that raising this many children is going to be a major challenge, but at the same time, it really does make things a bit more interesting. For extreme family players only!
This is a great, versatile mod for any Simmer, not just those looking to make pregnancy and family gameplay more realistic. However, it does allow the player to introduce varying lengths of pregnancy and even some mood swings to spice things up in the household.
Players who have Get To Work installed will know that they can join their pregnant Sim at the hospital when they finally give birth. This also provides them with the new birth certificate in their inventory, which can be placed on the wall as a decoration.

## Better babies is a mod for the sims 4 that changes some of the game's features to make childbirth more peaceful.

For those who don’t want a new little devil every time they press the Try for Baby option, here is a gentle solution. This baby mod smooths out the chances of getting pregnant in The Sims 4. It sets the odds somewhere in the middle so you don’t crate babies constantly. And this way, everything feels more natural.
Whereas in the vanilla version of the game, pregnant Sims were immune to death, this mod makes them like normal Sims. Pregnant Sims will no longer be safe from the hazards of the world, nor will they wait until giving birth to age up and die. It's the ultimate sad and realistic mod out there, perfect for storyteller Simmers.
For a simple combination of the essentials, the Pregnancy Mega Mod by scumbobo and java7nerd is an ideal pick for those who just want to have a bit more control over their offspring and increase the amount of storytelling that's available. This pregnancy mod for The Sims 4 is a combination of a few different ones and lets the player see how many babies a Sim will have, as well as their genders.
Interactions such as counseling, birth classes, etc, as well as discussing pregnancy with partners who see it in a more happy way, all have the ability to make a Sim closer to be able to be at peace with the pregnancy in question. There are a few new interactions as well, which I won’t list for now so I’m not spoiling everything.Sims will NOT autonomously accept a pregnancy; once they are ready to do so, it still comes to the player to decide. Because I don’t want to take the storytelling power out of your hands.
There is currently no definitely known way to influence the gender of an unborn child in The Sims 2. The only way to change the outcome is if the player saves while the mother is going through the labor animation, (or any time during pregnancy) before the "new baby on the way" popup comes up and the birth cutscene begins. If, after the birth, the baby is not the desired gender, the player can exit the lot without saving and go through the sequence again; this can be repeated until the baby is the desired gender. Since the chance of getting either gender is about 50%, this can take any number of tries to succeed.
On the last day of the pregnancy the Sim will attract the viewer once again and go into 'labor'. This is an autonomous action and all Sims on the lot or nearby will be drawn to the Sim to 'panic' (This includes the Grim Reaper if he is on the lot.) In The Sims 3 and in The Sims 4: Get to Work, the pregnant Sim can be taken to the hospital when clicked on while in labor, or they can stay at home, and have a safe and comfortable birth. The advantages of giving birth at the hospital are that the baby's bassinet will be provided free of charge and all of the pregnant Sim's motives will be replenished.
Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.
These by Katybug273 are a very good set for light and dark skin sims. The Sims 4 doesn't include stretch marks as skin details in the game (not yet at least) but now with Katybug273's and others' custom content you can bring a touch more realism to your Sim's pregnancy.
