In the base game, there are almost no solutions to aging down Sims. There are items that make your Sim immortal, but there are rarely some that help you make your Sim younger. And so, learning this cheat will be a great help for you no matter what type of gameplay you’re going for.
Our Sims in The Sims 4 age with time as all people in the real world do. Their aging speed is relative to the game we play, and they’re far from immortal. It often happens when you want to age down a Sim back to being young. So, how do you do that? What is the cheat to age down a Sim in Sims 4?
The Sims 4 allows you to evolve your character into an adult, but what if you want them to mature even more quickly? The Sims 4 age up cheat is here! You may now give your character the ability to alter their age whenever they desire. In this post, we'll go through how you utilize it in detail.
If your sims aren’t aging up, it’s likely because you have aging turned off in your game settings. To fix this, go into the game options in the menu panel. Find the gameplay tab and you’ll see various options pertaining to aging. Depending on who you want to age up, check the box to ‘auto age unplayed sims’ and have auto age for played sims on either ‘yes’ or ‘only active household.’

And just like in real life - the Sims also age (unless you switch their aging off in the settings).
