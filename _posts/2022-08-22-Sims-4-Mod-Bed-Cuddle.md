## Create a sims 4 mod that lets players cuddle!

You can even use this to “force” Sims to stay the Night with this. You may lock your Guestroom with my “Open Doors for chosen Sims” Mod so your guests are not disturbed by Sims who consider it “inappropriate” And to be sure they don’t sneak out in the middle of the Night you may lock the Main Door too.

Hi @aquilasimsTry resetting your user files as described in the factory reset described in this post: http://answers.ea.com/t5/The-Sims-4/FAQ-Troubleshooting-Steps-amp-Known-Issues/m-p/3621199You won't loose anything. Just make sure to not delete any files and make a backup.After renaming, repair your game by right clicking on the game in Origin.Try on a new game with nothing added back first (start new game). If it works, put back your save game and try again. If it still works, you can start putting stuff back.Options.ini (or just re-set all your settings manually)Tray FolderScreenshots/Videos/Custom musicRest of the save games (leave out slot_00000001.save which is the autosave and no longer needed - if you still have it)Custom content like clothing, hair, skins, make up ....ConfigOverride, if you have your own configuration files.Mods (one by one, making sure they all still work)The rest does not need putting back, cause they are mostly cache files that recreate or log files that are not needed for the game.

This is happening with single, double and bunk beds. NPCs seem to be able to sleep in beds, but my household can't. I have to keep making them take naps to increase their energy need.
Patreon does not allow commenting for anyone who is not another creator or a patron and there is absolutely nothing we can do about this policy (I wish, but they refuse to make it optional). We have plenty of other platforms for you to contact us on, and we have our support Discord linked in big letters in the Patreon creator description and a second time below that one in smaller text. I also have my own support server as well as the Creator Musings server (which you are also in btw), we both have Twitters, and I have Tumblr, Instagram, ModTheSims, and here too for contacting.
