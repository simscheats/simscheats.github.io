Welcome! This post is a complete collection of the best mods for Sims 4 in 2022. Here you’ll find extensions that can improve your gameplay and introduce new ways and game options to play TS4. So scroll down and pick your favorite mod for this year! Because although Electronic Arts (EA) did a great job with The Sims 4, modders and creators have managed to enrich the game tremendously!
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?
Say goodbye to generic, meaningless conversations and hello to meaningful, engaging chats with this mod for the Sims 4! As a fan of the Sims 4 who’s tired of seeing their storyless Sim friends chatting about nothing, this mod was made for you. You will be giving them some personality with this mod and never experience any more mundane conversations again. Install it from this page.
