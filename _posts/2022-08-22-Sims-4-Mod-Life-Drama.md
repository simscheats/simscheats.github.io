## Sims 4 mod life can be full of drama.

With love comes a lot of drama and for the amount of love that Sims 4 is dishing out, there doesn’t seem to be enough drama. Say no more! With this mod, you can add some controversy to every neighbourhood. You have a total of 11 dramatic scenarios for town NPCs and you can intervene in some of the interactions.

The Sims 4 base game comes with minimal amounts of drama, sure you can cheat on your partner or fight the old lady down the street, but what about when you want really juicy storylines. Drama mods are perfect for creating in-depth storylines and truly fleshing out your characters, it adds a sense of reality to sometimes unrealistic gameplay. This list will countdown the top 10 best drama mods.
Not to worry, because the Life Decider mod brings in some much-needed randomness into the world of The Sims 4. Now, you can have this mod randomize a Sims' entire life, by picking their traits, their career and even their skills. There's no better way to make things more interesting than a mod that chooses for you.
The beauty of The Sims 4 is that players decide themselves who they want to play as and what kind of stories they'd like to tell. However, sometimes too much control over things can get extremely boring and repetitive. People like surprises and challenges, which is why previous games in the franchise were so good and popular.
Let’s be honest, emotions in the Sims 4 are a little bit boring. They’re an interesting and fun system, adding more realism than what was shown in The Sims 3, but they’re not as good as they can be. The Meaningful Stories mod makes the game feel just a little more human.

Sims 4 is full of love. So much so that it’s pretty easy to find yourself in a relationship with another sim. Even if you don’t have a romantic relationship, all the romantic interactions are available and the player can choose which ones to use when interacting with another sim.
Ever wish there was more DRAMA in your sims’ lives? Affairs, fights, flirting, proposing, PDA (OohLaLa)! Base game NPCs just stand around vacantly or invade your personal conversations with no invitation. Here you can feel more humanity… and what is humanity without the love, lust, and tears. Life's Drama brings you all that, and much more! Become popular, be the queen bee, get plastic surgery, SPILL TEA!
Cheating is now much more realistic. If you want your sims to go through the pain of being cheated on, there’s now a whole host of options to try and justify yourself. You could lie and try and save your relationship, or tell the truth and let it crumble. You can also confess to cheating if the guilt is eating you alive.
Those interactions aren’t random, either: the mod will select them based on traits, moods and the existing relationships between the two Sims in question, which will give them a greater sense of autonomy than ever before. Expect more kisses from love interests—and more sucker punches from your enemies.

## Sims 4 mod life can be fun.

Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
