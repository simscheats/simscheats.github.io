## Sims 4 mod updater is a free software that allows you to update sims 4 games manually or automatically.

Every now and then there are Mod Updates or Patch Updates. Patch Updates are usually when a new pack is coming out. Sims 4 updates usually mean the mods we use need to be updated too, in order to work with the newest version of the game. Here are a few simple steps to take every time you update your game and mods (so that you don't break CC or experience game crashes):

There’s a new Sims 4 update available for PC/Mac and Consoles. If you have auto updates enabled in Origin’s “Application Settings”, the game will auto-update once you open Origin. If you have auto-updates disabled, you will need to manually update by clicking the game in your library.
When EA releases a patch update for The Sims 4, you have to install it. On Windows, Origin automatically installs updates by default. It notifies you that the game should be updated, and you must then close the game so the update can download. After Origin installs the update and you relaunch the game, the client informs you that all mods have been disabled.
This week’s The Sims 4 Update (version 1.77.131.1030) changed a lot of things in the game’s tuning files – causing a lot of Mods to break and not work properly in the game. There were also a lot of reports where the game broke due to outdated Mods, which is why it’s very important to disable Mods before checking if a new Mod version is required.
Electronic Arts frequently releases updates and patches for The Sims 4. When this happens, people might experience crashes during the game. Most often, though, mods are the culprit of game corruption. Luckily, there are a few precautions you can take to keep your game running smoothly.

In case you have Mods or Custom Content, the game will automatically disable them for you after first launching The Sims 4 after the update. To re-enable all your Mods and Custom Content, select the Settings option in the Menu and select Settings. Under the ”Other” section you’ll find the ”Enable Custom Content and Mods” option. Check it and restart your game in order for it to take effect!
Probably a long shot here, but is there such thing as a mod updater program where it will tell you that a mod needs to be updated? For the life of me I can't remember if the game tells you that a mod needs to be updated or not.. Like I have so many mods on my game and keeping track of what has and hasn’t been updated is a struggle for me.
The Sims 4 folder automatically generates a new “Mods” folder after you close the game. A “Resource.cfg” file will be the only thing in this folder. You must delete this re-created folder before you move your original “Mods” folder from your Desktop back to your Sims 4 folder.
