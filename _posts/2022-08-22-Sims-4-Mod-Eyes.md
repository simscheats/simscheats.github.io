## Install a mod to change sims eyes.

I didn’t use to be particular about what my Sims’ eyes looked like until I started watching Sims YouTubers. All their Sims had big, bright vibrant eyes, whereas mine were kinda dull looking. The secret was mods—not just for eyecolors, but for eyelashes and eyebrows as well. Gotta get those peepers in the right frames, after all.
This pretty much sums up the solutions you can use to get rid of the eye color bugs in The Sims 4. Being able to make custom eyes in the game is an interesting feature to have at hand. But sometimes, it’s exactly this type of custom content that may break some game options.
Second off, we have these smokey eyes for your male and female sims. They’re truly enchanting, so be sure that your sims will be attracting a great deal of attention and interest from those around them. The pack has 15 swatches to choose from. There are bright colors as well as dim ones. So, it’s most likely that you’ll find something to suit your character’s looks. Check it out on this page.
There are a ton of non-default eyes for Sims, but these eyes are a must-have! Choose from 22 swatches that include some authentic blue eyes, red ones, yellows, and more. But here’s a small tip: if you’d like your Sims eyes to genuinely pop and stand out, you’ll have to compliment the entire face with other makeup elements (eyebrows, eyelashes, eyeshadow, freckles if you’re into these, some blush too for sure). Here’s your download link.
Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s get to the mods. It’s quite easy to install Sims mods—just download these files and put them into the empty “Mods” folder in the game’s directory, which EA has helpfully placed there already for all you aspiring modders. None of the mods I have listed here conflict with one another, so feel free to install them all simultaneously.
Look at these eyes! Quite bright, shining eyes that come with reflective, glossy patches for your Sims. Compatible with the base game, these soft eyes have a beautiful, soft look to them that is enhanced by their reflective and shiny surface. Try all 42 different colors on your toddlers, teens, adults, and elders. And yes, worry not, it’s compatible with males and females alike. Here’s your download link.
STEP 1 - Open cas with your sim and enter detail edit mode. Once in detail edit hover your mouse over the tear duct of your sim ( the inner corner). Once it highlighted as seen above, pull drag your mouse to the left and you will see the eye shape become more almond like. Adjust this to your liking.
And why not be the center of all the attractiveness with these cosmic eyes? All of the 30 different shades hold some distant truth and one can get hypnotized simply by looking at them. Head over to The Sims Resource to find out more or download the CC quickly from here.
