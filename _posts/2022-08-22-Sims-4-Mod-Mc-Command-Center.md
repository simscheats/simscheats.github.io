## Mod installation and troubleshooting.

First of all, make sure that you have the correct version of the MCCC mod. When you download the mod, look for the latest version. Both MCMM and your game‚Äôs patch should be compatible with each other. Read in the description of the mod for which game version it‚Äôs intended.

I logged in just to confirm that that's the issue. If you have the Mods folder and you wish to keep things organized, you can do so, but make sure that you don't have more sub-folders than 1 when running this. This is pretty much available for most Mods, I am now realizing that some of the mods I've got don't even work because I had them too deep in sub-folders.
This link will take you to the official download page of MCMM. On your left, you‚Äôll see the different MCCC versions and the additional mods alongside the core mod. The first thing on the list is usually the latest version of the MC Command Center so download that.
When you install MCCC for the first time, you will need to edit and save the Resource.cfg file. This is necessary the first time, but only once (even when you update the mod). You also only need to do this if you are not using specified sub-folders within your mods folder. If you are organizing with folders, you can skip this step.
Note: If you have other mods and want to keep them organized, you can add one layer of the folder for the Mods folders. For example, you can create an MCCC folder within the Mods folder, but not another within the MCCC folder. If you do this, the mods will not be detected by the game.

The MCCC mod was created by Deaderpool, who still has the download hosted on their personal blog. From there, you will navigate to the MCCC Downloads tab. This will show you all of the most recent versions of the mod with helpful descriptions for compatibility.
If you are wondering why is the¬†MC Woohoo not showing up, it doesn‚Äôt actually appear over your Sims MC Menu. The mod only appears within the computer-based MC Menu. So you should check through the mod folder and make sure all the files are present inside.
Now, make sure that the packages and modules are inside the same folder. Also, this particular folder shouldn‚Äôt go deeper than one level in Sims 4 folder. For example, a folder ‚ÄúThe Sims 4\Mods\MCCC‚Äù is perfectly fine. However, a folder ‚ÄúThe Sims 4\Mods\Script Mods\MCCC‚Äù‚Äô isn‚Äôt right. The game Sims 4 shall only penetrate one-level deep while it‚Äôs searching for the scripts in the mods.
I thought I could fix this problem by taking out chunks of my cc and mods to see what was causing the problem (you can do that if you want). BUT my cc wasn't the real reason that mccc wasn‚Äôt working. It turned out that because I put mccc in a folder I created inside the mods folder, it wasn‚Äôt showing up in my game. Idk why this was the reason, but I just placed it directly into the mods folder, hopefully you understand, it‚Äôs kinda hard to explain üòÖ.

## Command center features.

I made sure that my customer content and script mod option is checked off, and it does show the mods installed at startup so it is recognizing that it's there but I don't see the option for the command center when I click on my Sim, or a computer. Please help!!! :s [/quote]
