## Create your own sims 4 mods with mod packs.

Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.

This handy mod by Weerbesu makes using Sims 4 cheats a breeze if you don't know the lot by heart. Right-clicking various parts of the normal Sims 4 interface will give you extra options for things like giving a household more money, promoting Sims in their careers, or changing the in-game time. You can find the full list of features by scrolling down a bit on the download page.
If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
Many of the best Sims 4 mods affect the ways Sims interact with each other. The Sims 4 has a long list of traits that change the way a Sim behaves, and because they’re relatively easy for modders to create you can quickly expand that list through custom content.

Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.
Although The Sims 4 already features a pretty extensive list of traits that are designed to affect the way your Sims behave, modders are always looking to add more options to the game. If you happen to find yourself shopping around for some new Sim traits, Kutto’s New Hobby Traits mod is an excellent place to start.
There are also lots of automatic settings geared towards letting non-controlled Sims live full lives without you, getting married and having babies of their own volition, and you can also use the mod to adjust the in-game time settings so your Sims don’t take half a day to shower and have breakfast. If you only grab one mod, make it this one.
Well, it's possible now, with this mod by Kawaiistacie. Sure, it's all rabbit holes, but it brings some much-needed variety into the game. This mod comes with a bunch of different things Sims can do, such as getting their nails done and actually returning with a brand new polish.

This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
Each new pack release in the game sees the army of modders on Tumblr, Patreon, and sites like ModTheSims jumping in to improve features or expand upon them. After trawling the internet, we’ve put together a list of our personal best mods for The Sims 4.
