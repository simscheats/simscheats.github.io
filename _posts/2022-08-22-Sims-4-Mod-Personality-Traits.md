## Sims 4 mod personality traits

And the last trait that we want to showcase here is the pyromaniac trait. We admit this isn’t among the most popular nor the most impactful trait mods for The Sims 4. However, playing the game with a pyromaniac Sim is one hell of a blast (pun intended)!

These mods although seemingly negative add a lot of realism to The Sims, hence its popularity amongst the community with almost 90,000 downloads on Mod the Sims. The moodlets that the traits give also provide some interesting story scenarios, for example, a child born from spellcasters who is allergic to magic and struggling to find their place in the world. The Fame Jealous trait is also a great option for players who have The Sims 4: Get Famous installed and are bored of NPCs constantly fawning over celebrities and passing out.
While the base Sims 4 game comes with around 40 Traits, players can go online and download from thousands of unique personality characteristics. These Traits can range from more specific basic Traits such as "Diva" or "Daydreamer," The Sims 4's sci-fi or fantasy Traits like "Robot," modern Traits like "Instagram Baddie," along with many many more. If the player wants a specific Trait for their Sim, chances are they can find a custom version of it.
All of these traits deal with your sims emotions and moods, typically making them more extreme. For example, the insecure trait makes the embarrassed emotion more common and more intense. The trait will also make it more difficult for sims to make friends. Super realistic!
Our next trait is the modest trait which is a great trait to have, the description of this one states “These sims are not prideful nor are they egotistic. They take great pride in dressing nicely and are kind, helpful, but do not allow people to walk over them.”

When it comes to emotions, The Sims 4 can also sometimes seem too immature. Sure, we have our Sims have the most basic emotional responses, but that’s all of it. However, in the case of the “New Emotional Traits” mod, you’re looking at a completely different thing!
The anti-social mastermind trait is an interesting one and makes it so your sims aren’t fans of being friends with others but absolutely love the mischief skill. The description of this trait states “These sims are extremely anti-social and have no conscience. They are prideful, aggressive and live a selfish and lonely life.”
Sadly, depression is another widespread condition in our modern world. And while we think of ways how to solve this issue in our society, we can try it out in The Sims 4 too. Yes, the Depressed Trait mod is another highly realistic trait that you should definitely try.
The next trait iswarm-heartedthat has a description that says “Who doesn’t love warm-hearted sims? These sims tend to put the needs of others over their own needs. They feel strong sense of responsibility and duty. They are extremely energetic and loving. Thus, being hurt by unforgiveness and unkindness, they strongly dislike people with low standards and conduct.”

## Sims 4 mod traits for mods

Traits in the Sims 4 are severely lacking any sort of originality. Sure, you get a few new traits with each expansion pack, but they’re not very fun even then. Luckily for us, we have modders! There are a ton of custom traits available for download, so it’s easy to search and find anything specific that you want. This list will count down the 10 best trait mods for the Sims 4.
Trait mods are a really great way to keep your sims feeling different and more interesting since players can often end up making the exact same sim over and over with the lack of traits in the game. Since you now have a sims 4 more traits mod you can use more of these than ever before.
As mentioned above, the Sims 4 trait mods are deeply personal. And although I showcased many quality trait mods in this post, the choice of which one you should download is ultimately yours. Everybody is different and everyone plays the game in a unique way. So, download the trait mods that you want to select for your own Sims!
It is important to note with these mods that there is some conflicts in The Sims 4 with certain traits when you add too many. You may not see a lot of interactions from one trait when you have 5 and the game may focus on a couple instead of all of them.
However, we highly advise you to try as many of the showcased mods as possible. Traits will not change the way you play the game essentially, but they will introduce new perspectives. At the least, they will refreshen your playtime and make you want to play The Sims 4 even more!
In this list, you’ll find the best trait mods for Sims 4 no matter if you’re looking simply for fun, for gameplay improvements, or for adding more realism to the game. These 40 trait extensions are exceptional in every aspect and I totally recommend them.
These sims 4 more traits mods are going to seriously change how you use traits in the game and let you have so many more interesting traits to add to your more trait slots mod as well. Your sims are going to feel so much more interesting and fun and make you enjoy playing with them so much more. Happy Playing!
And lastly, there are many many more trait mods for The Sims 4 all over the internet. Frankly speaking, new ones get uploaded every day! Here I have only listed our (SnootySims crew) personal favorites and the ones that we have enjoyed the most as veteran simmers.
