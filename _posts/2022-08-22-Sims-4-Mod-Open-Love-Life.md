## Open the "love life" mod for the sims 4.

I've found that the best way to make poly sims is to use the player trait but also, in the case of marriage with poly sims, you can use the cheat relationship.add_bit family_husband_wife on all of the people within the relationship so it registers them as married

@tsarakaMods:MC Command Center: The MC Woohoo module includes a "disable jealousy" option under MC Woohoo - Woohoo ReactionsWonderful Whims: You can give your Sims the "wonderful attribute" Polyamorous!No mods (does involve cheats):Base game: Control-shift-c to open the console, testing cheats on , and then Traits.equip_trait Player. If you want extra satisfaction points as well, instead turn on testing cheats and then set their aspiration to Serial Romantic and type Aspirations.Complete_Current_Milestone until the aspiration is achieved and the game gives you the Player reward trait. Do this for all the Sims you want to be in the relationship.Get Together: Press the U key to open the club interface (if you have Discover University it might show you university organizations instead, but there's a tab to show you clubs). Create a new club ("Polyamory club"?) and add the Sims you want to be involved. Add the club activity "Be romantic with" and choose for the target of that activty your club ("Polyamory club"?). I like to add banned action, "be mean" as well because that's the way I roll.Eco Lifestyle: Shift-click the mailbox and choose Instant Add NAP (cheat) and choose the Free Love NAP. Just be careful, if this is the only one you're using, to only be romantic at home because the no jealousy part only works in the neighborhood.
You can also just equip any trait with the traits cheat: https://www.reddit.com/r/sims4Cheats/wiki/index#wiki_trait_cheats -- I do that for Sims I add to my world but aren't intending to actively play just to give them a bit more of a dimension and purpose; giving them a few of the aspiration traits or purchasable traits can help flesh them out a bit.
As you already understood, Sims will now have relationship preferences:- Polygamous/Single- Monogamous/For Two RelationshipsSims with the same preferences will feel happier together than Sims with opposite outlooks on life, well, if their outlook on life still differ, they will feel out of place and constantly worry about this.- You may also meet a character who will be indifferent to any kind of relationship, in other words - do not care. Such people are not averse to trying something new and may agree to an experiment in relationships in order to please their partner.- Characters ranging from teenagers to oldies will automatically generate preferences:50% monogamy25% indifferent25% open relationship- You can change both the preference of the playable character and NPC using the settings menu- Characters who agree to an open relationship will not be show jealousy towards each other, unless of course they have the "Jealous" character trait- Depending on their views on life, the characters can respond to the proposal to enter into an open relationship with you in return, or, conversely, send you to hell.- Completely new character traits related to preferences- A bunch of new moodlets, moodlets and emotions have been added- New dialogues and reactions to them- Even some NPCs with special interactions, unless of course a spark has run between you, can call and offer to enter into an open relationship with them .- While in an open relationship, Sims can negotiate with each other to change their relationship to monogamous.

Will Sims find others with the same relaitonship preferences and live their best love life – or tangle themselves up into poorly fitting arrangements? Sims now all have relationship preferences (preferss exclusivity, indifferent, prefers non-exclusive relationships) and react accordingly….
I had an accidental poly household. I had 6 single sims and they NEVER got upset when the others flirted with who they were kinda paired up with. The eco life NAP free love was on and I didn't know (it ruined the plot challenge for me but may work for you as an option as mine weren't meant to be poly)
What's New: Added new relationship types such as Swedish Family and Side Partner.- Characters can now have pairs of 3 people at the same time. Of course, they will not be jealous of each other.- Your character will have access to an official lover, in other words, a side partner, if the official couple approved his choice. Naturally, in this case, there will be no jealousy. In turn, the couple or spouse in return can also ask your character for permission to have a lover.- In order for the character to ask a new partner to enter into such a relationship, there must be at least an affair between them.- Sims can either accept or refuse this kind of offer to become part of a Swedish family based on their relationship preferences.- Only after the character and his partner come to an agreement to accept another person in their relationship, they can initiate a third party into this. The third party, in turn, will react based on relationship preference.- But, if a threesome from an open relationship is already formed, and one of the characters included in it starts running to the side, and one of the partners sees it with their own eyes, then jealousy cannot be avoided. So look around more often, running to the left!
If you're willing to use Mods, you can use MCCC to disable jealousy and allow multiple marriages.If you're not:If you use the Free Love NAP you can do this, but be careful if they travel to areas not covered by the NAP (like, don't take both sweeties on a date to Sulani if Sulani doesn't have Free Love, for example). (Requires Eco Lifestyle.)Give everyone in the relationship the Player reward trait from the Serial Romantic aspiration. (Base Game.)You might also be able to add all the people in the relationship into a Polyamory Club and make club activities Be Romantic with Polyamory Club, etc. (Requires Get Together.)
