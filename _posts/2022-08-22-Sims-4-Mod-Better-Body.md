## Improves the appearance of the sims 4.

Considering that The Sims once had very limited sliders, The Sims 4 is pretty revolutionary with its CAS mode. Creating a Sim feels very intuitive these days, and there's a decent room for customization even with the default sliders. That being said, not everything can be changed.
The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience.

When we moved from The Sims 3 to The Sims 4, one of the things that I missed the most (and there are a lot of things we all miss, of course) was the fact that the traits you could assign to your Sims decreased from six to three. But, thanks to this mod from chingyu1023 (opens in new tab) (based on the original from Embyr311 (opens in new tab), which hasn't been updated since 2016) that lets you add more Create a Sim traits, there's a way to get back to the standards that The Sims 3 set.

Another thing missing in The Sims 4 from The Sims 3 is vehicles. I loved it when you could drive around the neighbourhood to get to different locations, or just watch your kids cycle about from their friends' houses after school. But it all disappeared in The Sims 4. Thankfully, The Sims 4 community is on hand to right some of the wrongs in the game, and thanks to this ownable cars mod (opens in new tab) from Dark Gaia your Sims can now purchase and drive their very own cars around the neighbourhood as the modern age intended.
The Sims 4 custom slider was developed in a combination of four unique options and packages, including extended sliders like EarEar Up/Down, Hand Size, Finger Thickness, and Facial symmetry. This module is also an all-in-one Sims 4 slider that would no longer require downloading separate mods. This one is enough. It is available for teens and elders and also has six different and unique ear shapes. Also, it doesn’t require any other additional files.
