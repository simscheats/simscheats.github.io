## Create a sims 4 mod that allows users to take vacations.

Sims can be sent on vacation by clicking on the telephone, and selecting "Call Cab...", then "Go On Vacation". If any family members are not at home, a notice will appear saying that the family cannot go on vacation unless all members are home. Otherwise, the player will be prompted to confirm that they want the family to go on vacation. Clicking "OK" will call the Vacation Island SUV. When it appears, the family will get in and be charged §500. The SUV will drive away and the Vacation Island screen will appear. Selecting a lot will deliver the family to that lot, and they will be dressed appropriately for that area of the island. There is no limit on how long the family can stay, but they will not be able to sleep unless an adult member checks in at a hotel desk, or rents igloos or tents. Pets travel with the family, but small pets do not.[TS:U]

13.) Pets and toddlers on Vacation– Normally, only humans from child to elder can travel to vacation destinations. This mod allows to add: toddlers, dogs, cats, puppies, kittens
Practically everyone except babies. Sims can: take their household members and invite pets and toddlers from other families as guest vacationers (provided they’re friends)
The Sims 4 Explore Mod has numerous fantastic features that we like. We especially enjoyed the DMV visit for the car license and the part where the gambling addiction becomes too serious. In the case of the latter, know that you don’t have to have it at all. You can simply check whether you want to gamble or not and whether to only do it at home or other places. The other features like the dancing and the yoga class are super fun as well, and we recommend you to try them all!
Want to give your Sims the lifestyle of the rich and famous? Then try out Sacrificial Road to Fame mod! This mod adds tons of new gameplay, including skills (Simstagram Skill), fame levels, buffs, new interactions and animations, fans and paparazzi and more!
Anyway you can take a vacation anywhere. Build a resort type lot with any non-residential lot type with rooms with beds and other necessities to stay in then go there, and call into work daily and you can vacation anywhere for free. Just in case the mod let's you down.

Don't worry, though—it's not all work and no play. The mod adds in random events, like field trips (your Sims will randomly be transported somewhere in town, like a museum or park, and have "field trip" activities to do instead), and school dress-up day, where all your classmates come dressed in costumes. You can even choose to skip school and play hooky, if you want. There's now a "hooky" skill that your Sim can work on to evade school with no negative effects.
Vacations offer Sims the possibility of travelling to new neighborhoods and worlds, without having to move away from their current lot. Vacations are usually booked in beforehand and Sims can stay for a set period of time in various establishments such as hotels, or other forms of rental lots. Vacation worlds offer activities and experiences that wouldn't normally be possible in residential worlds. They can range from exploring new cultures to interacting with unique objects, buying souvenirs or even adventures in secret tombs.
The Sims 4 makes it easier than ever: simply download the mod in question, unzip the files (they will typically end in .package), and then drag and drop them into the "Mods" folder, which is already located in your Sims files (navigate to Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4Mods to locate).
Sims can go on vacation with up to seven other Sims only through their phone or computer's "Take a Vacation" function. For some reason, children can also initiate vacations through the computer. At least one rental lot is required in the world so that Sims have a place to stay. Sims can join the vacation at any time and may leave at any time. Sims get the "On Vacation" description instead of the number of days/hours when a Sim goes to work. If a Sim is doing poorly in school, the principal may call in several times during after-school hours. A Sim's job or school performance does not decrease while they're on vacation. Sims who are not part of the household will later leave the vacation lot if they have school/work that falls in the middle of vacation and will not be able to return to vacation once their school/work day is over.

## Create a sims 4 mod that allows users to travel to different locations.

Without the Explore Mod, The Sims 4 would be a pretty limited experience. The base game has done very little in satisfying us on the traveling point. Yes, our Sims can have a lovely home and do all kinds of crazy stuff inside and outside of their houses. But, nothing more, right? Well, we’re about to change that!
Once the Sims have arrived, they can start exploring their vacation world. They can talk to the tour guide to take a tour, call a cab, or use the interaction "Walk to Lot" to explore the community lots. To go to a secret location, make sure the Sim with the map is the selected Sim.

The Sims can choose which destination they wish to go to as well as what hotel (or vacation home if they already own one) they would like to stay at upon arrival. It is also possible to choose once the Sims have flown to their destination rather than choosing immediately when booking by selecting "Choose Upon Arrival".
As in the previous two games mentioned, Sims once again have the choice of partaking in three different forms of vacations. However, in a first for the series, the new vacation destinations are based on real-world locations. Sims are able to vacation in new locations: Shang Simla, Champs Les Sims and Al Simhara. These new locations are the same size as the neighborhoods Sunset Valley and Riverview, and parody the countries of China, France and Egypt respectively. Pets cannot go abroad.[TS3:P]
When we said that The Sims 4 Explore Mod is one of the best additions to the game, we really meant it. Not only does it add new features and stuff, but it also opens up a whole different gameplay option. It lets our Sims leave their lots through rabbit holes and discover whole new worlds for them! There are over 60 new places that they can visit, and you can go with them too!
Why would Sims need cars at all? Still, The Sims 2 was closed-world, and cars still added a lot of character to the Sims that drove them. In Adeepindigo’s SimNation Travel mod, functional cars make a return. But that’s not all; from improved bikes to subways to new vacation options, SimNation Travel is a great addition to any save.
To travel to most lots, the fastest way is to jump to the city map by pressing the M key or clicking the map button near the top-right corner of the screen. The Sim you have currently active will be in the traveling party, but after selecting a lot, you can choose which friends or family you wish to travel with. Sims not in the current family are guaranteed to arrive with yours regardless of relationship levels.
