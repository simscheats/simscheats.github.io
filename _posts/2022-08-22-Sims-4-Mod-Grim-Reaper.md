## Sims 4 grim reaper is a popular mod that allows players to control death.

Anyone know how to make this work? I have seen some youtube videos of a guy doing it, I'm not going to link them because I think the are inappropriate to link, but they can be searched when googling "Sims 4 Woohoo Grim Reaper". He is very obviously using a few mods and I am trying to figure out which.

If you’re tired of playing with the Reaper, you can remove him from your household.
Type move_object on, select the Grim Reaper and then hit the Delete key. Select the dead Sim and hit the Delete key again to remove all the traces of the Reaper from your household.
The Grim Reaper appears in the console versions of The Sims and The Sims: Bustin' Out. He appears similarly to his appearance in The Sims: House Party, though his icon in those games show a white skull in a black cloak robe. He appears whenever a Sim dies due to a fire and comes to collect their spirit. As in the PC version, the Grim Reaper can be plead with by Sims to attempt to have a dead sim get a second chance at life. In Get a Life mode, if he reaps the soul of a dead Sim, a game over will result, and the player will lose all progress and be forced to start over from the beginning or from the last save game.
In The Sims 2: FreeTime, Sims may ask the genie to give them the power to cheat death. This enables them to plead for their own life with a 100% chance of success the first time, which decreases by 10% with each subsequent attempt. Sims who die of old age will only get an extra day. In The Sims 2: Apartment Life, good witches with Level 9 magic skill and the correct ingredients can cast the Expello Mortis spell to banish the Grim Reaper, saving a dying Sim. Also, an evil witch with 9 Magic skill points and correct ingredients can cast the Vivificus Zombiae spell at the tombstone or urn of a Sim, and the Sim will return as a zombie.
Sims with level 5 or more in mischief skill can "Toy with Death" using a voodoo doll. The Grim Reaper will lose the ability to reap Sim's life. Success chance will depend on how many times the Sim toys with Death before the Grim Reaper decides to reap the dying Sim.

↑Details: In The Sims 4, each time the Sim toys with Death, the Grim Reaper gains a little bit of "clemency" (This is tracked internally by the game). Once the Grim Reaper gains enough clemency, there will be a chance that the Reaper will spare the Sim. The more clemency the Reaper has, the greater the chance he will revive the dying Sim. Source: Taken from game data files.
All Sims that die will be reborn as ghosts where they can find the Grim Reaper standing at the front of the lot where they can challenge him to a fiddle contest. Sims that have a higher creativity skill and have died when in Platinum mood have a higher chance of winning. If the Sim wins then the Grim Reaper will disappear.
In The Sims 4, the Grim Reaper has a slightly different physical appearance compared to the previous series. The Grim Reaper wears a black, modern cloak, instead of a torn-down cloak. When reaping the souls, the Grim Reaper no longer has the death list on a piece of paper. Instead, he'll use a tablet which has the death list.
