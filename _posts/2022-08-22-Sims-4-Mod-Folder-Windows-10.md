## How to download and install mods for the sims 4 on windows 10.

Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.

I recently got a new laptop and downloaded Windows 10 on it. I downloaded Sims 4, (I had played it before on other laptops) and I wanted to put custom content in my game, like always. But I searched and I couldn't find the mods folder anywhere in the Electronic Arts/The Sims 4. I also couldn't find the saves folder either. Does anybody else have this problem, know anything about it, know how to help??
Installing script mods is again, pretty similar to installing the other mods listed above. The main difference, however, is that the file type will end in .ts4script. For these kind of mods, you'll still put them into your Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods folder, but you'll also need to make sure in your game settings that you have Script Mods enabled.
So.. I know how to download cc and all, but I just got a new laptop and I downloaded the Sims. Sadly, I can't fimd the Mods folder anywhere. I don't even have the Electronic Arts folder in the Documents folder-thing. I don't know what went wrong but I would appreciate some help or advice. Thanks!
Make sure you are connected to the internet, then open Origin, go to The Sims 4 in your Game Library, click on the Settings tab, and then click on the Update Game button. If your game does need any updates, Origin will automatically download and install them. If your game is already fully updated, you'll get a notification telling you so.

Go to your Sims 4 folder, right-click on the folder titled "Saves" and then copy it. Paste your Saves folder somewhere else on your computer, like your desktop. That way you'll have a "safe" version of your saved game in case anything goes wrong while testing.
I'm not sure whether you're still having the problem but I not long ago had the problem too, I do everything that everyone stated above but nothing even played for 5 minutes (probably longer) but I think I might of found a way you can find it, Not sure whether it'll work but... Click on This PC, then Click on your C Drive, which'll look like this -- Acer ( C : ) (Without spaces) -- If you've clicked on it, then you'll see a bunch of folders, Some with program files, etc.. Click on the folder that says 'Users' then once you've done that, Click on the one folder that has your PC's name on it, Like what you've named your PC, For example mine's -- Shyanne -- As that's my name, I know original, but once you've done that then you'll see all the same folders you have at the side but for some strange reason are completely different, click on documents after the PC's named folder, once you've also done that you'll be directed to some more folders, Click on Electronic Arts then Sims 4 then Mods. Hopefully this helped I do really suck at explaining stuff, I also tend to babble, If you understand anything from above then awesome.If there's nothing there still then I have no absolute clue, I do hope you get it solved quick though as I know it's horrible specially when you'd like to play the game. - Shy. xoxo.
Hi, I have a problem, I followed all the steps, but when I download the mods and put them in the folder it still doesn't appear in the game, there is this window telling me about the mods that I downloaded but they still don't appear in the game... Can someone help me?
Downloaded Lots and Sims use several different types of files. Lots can be either a .blueprint, .bpi, or .trayitem file, while Sims can be .hhi, .householidbinary, .sgi, or .trayitem file types. Again there are no steps required to install these files past placing them in the Tray folder, or a relevant subfolder within that.

## How to find and download mods for the sims 4.

Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.
Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
