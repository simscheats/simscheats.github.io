The Sims 4 Extreme Violence mod adds a plethora of unsightly delights to the game. Famed for the numerous ways of murdering fellow Sims, the mod lets you live out your criminal wants and needs. The added murders range from running over Sims with a car, mowing down civilians with an Uzi, literally ripping out a Sims heart, and many, many more!
To download this Sims 4 murder mod, follow this direct link. The mod has been developed by sacrificialmods. Their website hosts a number of great mods for the game. And it’s also the place where the Extreme Violence murder mod for The Sims 4 has been published and kept updated all through 2020 and 2021. So, pay them a visit!

Basically, you can get in a really good fight without having to murder someone.

Have you ever tried modding a Sims 4 game to have a gaggle of female sims in Victorian ball gowns stab other ball goers to death? I have and I don’t recommend it. The amount of clipping and whatever else happened to my poor integrated graphics was too much for the game to bear. It crashed and forced me to redownload all 40 gigabytes of the game.

If you ever wished to turn The Sims 4 into a true murder mod show, then you’ve come to the right place! In The Sims 4, murder can’t really happen without mods, or at least not exactly how we want it to happen. Instead, we’re forced to use mods that allow this feature. But, that won’t be a bad thing once you see how perfect this mod is!
There’s even a feature of this mod that lets you use toddlers to kill adult sims. Nuts, I know, but undeniably fun for a lot of players. Add to that the drugs of the Basemental Drugs mod and the unscrupulous fornication that the Wicked Whims mod supports and you have a truly deprived playthrough.
To install, simply download the file. Then, extract to a destination: the mods folder of your Sims 4 program files (or cut and paste the extracted files). Make sure not to put the files inside a subfolder, as this will not let it work. Finally, allow ‘mods’ and ‘script mods’ in the game options menu. There you have it – the Extreme Violence mod is installed and ready to go!
