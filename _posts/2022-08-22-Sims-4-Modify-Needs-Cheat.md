Are your sim’s needs getting way too demanding? Let’s fix that! Here’s a helpful list of sims 4 needs cheats so you can quickly fill your sim’s need bar or turn off need decay altogether. I’ll also tell you how to fill your sim’s needs with the click of a button, answer frequently asked questions, and give you the best sims 4 needs mods.
This includes altering the needs of the Sims located on the lot. Alternatively, the player can simply press CTRL + SHIFT + C and type in fillmotive x and replace the "x" with the need which the player wants to be filled such as energy, hunger, or social.
If you don't want to use cheats to make full your Sims' needs, you'll need to monitor each Sim's respective needs and react to low needs by placing the Sim in situations in which the need(s) will be raised. For example, if you have a Sim who has a low "Social" needs bar, placing that Sim in a room full of people will raise their needs.
If you want more fine control, or your're trying to add and remove other properties, here is your list of traits from game packs and expansions that you may want to give your Sims. A Sim's Lifestyles, which reflect the habits they've developed as you play them, are also added and removed as traits.

Keeping your sims needs full at all times is an overwhelming experience when you have more than one sim to care for. Your sims are constantly peeing their pants or falling asleep on the floor before you can ever manage to care for them properly. What’s a simmer to do?
This will allow you to create a completely new and identical sim that can be edited easily with the help of full edit mode in Sims 4. While you do this, you may notice that the traits, clothes, facial hairs, and aspirations still remain the same for the identical character you have created.
Hunting for Sims 4 cheats to liven up your game? There is no more classic combo than cheats and Sims, whether you simply want a little extra cash, a free house, or want to bring a family member back from the dead. With cheats you can forget trivial concerns like money or mortality and instead focus on playing around and having fun.
To make your Sims’ need full, first open the cheat console by pressing control, shift, C on a Windows computer, or Command, Shift, C on a Mac. Then, type in “Testingcheats on” and press Enter, which will enable cheats. Once cheats are enabled, select a Sim and note which of their needs require filling up. After you’ve decided which need you want to fill up, type “fillmotive motive_” followed by the need into the cheat console. For example, enter “fillmotive motive_social” to fill up your Sim’s social bar. You can also fill up all of their needs by holding down Shift when you click on a Sim, selecting Cheat needs from the pop-up menu, and clicking on “Make happy.” Remember that you’ll have to re-enter your chosen cheat periodically, since your Sims will still use up their needs over time.

## This cheat modifies the needs of your sims.

If you’re fortunate enough to be a PC or Mac player (sorry console) you also have the option of download some cheat mods to be able to use these instead of typing in cheat codes and going down the hard way. There are two really incredible mods that can make it so you can easily cheat your sim’s needs with just the click of a button.
I use mods to quickly and easily cheat my sims needs. No more having to write out long cheat codes. With one click of a button, you can fill up your sim’s needs. The mods I’m going to share with you are also listed in my must-have mods for sims 4 post because they really are some of the best mods out there.
You absolutely NEED this mod if you are a player that cheats your sim’s needs a lot. To explain what this mod does in simplest terms, instead of having to type cheats codes into the cheats bar, you can visually click on things in the sims 4 UI (such as skills, needs, money, etc.) to alter them.
Since the game's infancy, the Sims has always offered cheat codes to enhance gameplay and give players helpful bonuses. There's a cheat or a mod for almost everything; however, mods are a bit more complicated, even though the right ones can make for incredibly realistic gameplay. If you're not in the mood for downloading and meticulously organizing a bunch of files needed to make a mod, it's best to stick with good old cheat codes.
To ensure that these needs cheats work properly, make sure you have testingcheats on, you’re clicked on the sim that you want to alter, and that the cheat code is typed correctly. I suggest using copy & paste from your browser into the game to prevent any possible typos.
And if you have any problem with other parts of The Sims 4, feel free to visit our cheat page. There you can find all sorts of cheats for all sorts of confusing things in The Sims 4, like unlocking all objects in the game or using the buydebug cheat. Try us out!
The first mod is the UI Cheats Extension Mod which allows you to click on any of the UI in the game and cheat things that way. You’re able to click with your left mouse button on any part of the need bar to make it so your sim has that much of that need to wherever you click.
Once you type in the cheat, in the window below the command bar it will say “Has sim id:” followed by a long number. You only need to know the number that is generated. This is your Sim ID for that sim. If you have other sims in your household you will need their Sim ID as well, as each sim has their very own Sim ID.
