## Sim's 4 mod folder not showing up

Hi @simmercutie1,Creating the folder is not enough as you need a file resource.cfg inside your folder for mods to work.If it's missing, the Mods folder and resource file will be regenerated by the game the next time you open your game. Once the game has created the Mods folder and the resource file inside it, you can install your games as usual.-Mai

Hi so I’m having a similar problem. On my windows 10, I downloaded all my mods accordingly, put them in the mods folder, and played about 2 months ago. However, this afternoon, the mods were not working. I deleted them all after trying to re-zip the files, then re-downloaded them. I did the same things to install them but they’re still not showing up whatsoever and it’s really annoying lol. Anyone can help me with this? Also, please simplify any answers im really stupid lol...
Mod files in .zip format: The mod files which you download through the internet are in a zipped format. In order to properly place them in the correct location, you need to unzip them and then place the contents. If this isn’t the case, the mods will fail to work.
If the mod itself needs an update, make sure to leave a comment about it on its download page. However, if there is no issue with compatibility, try checking whether the mod package is unzipped. Depending on your PC operating system, the instructions for unzipping a folder differ slightly.
Bad mods: If there are any corrupt or bad mods in your mods directory, there is a possibility that the entire batch of mods will not work. Here we have to apply a technique where we test each mod one by one to find the culprit and disregard it from the folder.

so I have a mods folder and the resource.cfg file is there, checked the properties and mods are enabled. I played the game one day and all my mods worked fine, the next day none of them are showing up in game at all. even though my computer says they are all still there. ive uninstalled, reinstalled, moved the file out and back in and every other suggestion I have found so far and none are working but I also haven't found a solution to this specific problem. anyone have any other suggestions?
Open up your Mods folder, and make sure you've placed the CC correctly. Remember, you should only see files ending in .package or .ts4script in your mods folder. If the files are ending in .zip, .rar., or any other file type, they won't work in your game!
There are several ways you can organize your Mods folder. I like to do mine by categories, as seen in the picture above. This doesn't really do anything special during the gameplay, but it allows me to easily find content in my folders, install new content, and delete or update old content.
I just completed a digital download via Origin of TS4 deluxe and Get To Work. I want to quickly install some custom content before I go in-game but can't locate the 'Electronic Arts' or 'Mods' folders in my computer. I have used two search engines (spotlight search and the finder search) and nothing comes up, and have also manually scrolled through all my documents looking for the folders. I don't know what to do.. have I done something wrong in the installation process? Does anyone know why my folders might be missing in action?

## Why sims 4 mod folder not showing up

@chloherm714Did your folder get deleted or does your mods not show up in game? The file directory is your folder, what exactly are you asking for?Usually you have the mods in C:\Users\Username\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\mods, if you deleted them, check your trash can.If you have the mods in the folder but they're not showing up in game:I guess you double checked that script mods and cc were activated in the game options? Both of them?And then you have mods that do not work? All mods or just some? If it's just some mods that do not work, which ones?If no mods show up in your gameDid you place them in C:\Users\Username\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\ModsDo the game register that there are mods? Do they show up in the list in the beginning or if you open the mods list from the options menu?Do you have OneDrive on your computer? Make sure that the game is not using the OneDrive-folders. Try turning off OneDrive before starting the game.You can check where the game saves your files by looking in your Game Options - Screenshot settings.Make sure that the path above is the same place as where you have your saves and mods.
In Sims 4, an option is provided to allow players to enable or disable the mods in game according to their needs. If this option is disabled, you will definitely experience Sims 4 mods not showing up issue. So, you should firstly check if mods are enabled in your Sims 4. To do that, you need to:
Hi @tabiisemoji8, please explain your problem a bit more! Did you delete your folder or does your mods not show up in the game?If the mods are not showing up: Did your cc work before today? Have you made any changes since the last time playing?- Make sure cc/mods is enabled in game (check the boxes in the game options)If you deleted your folder: Make sure there is no "Mods"-folder in C:\Users\Username\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4Restart the gameExit the gameCheck C:\Users\Meki\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4 again, a new folder, called Mods, should be created.

Finally, uninstalling and reinstalling the Sims 4 is the last resort to fix mods notworking problem. You can completely remove the Sims 4 from your computer and then download the latest version of the game from the official website. Then, install the game according to the given instruction and check if Sims 4 mods not showing up issue is removed.
When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.
In this case, you should create a new household and check if it can load the mods. If Sims 4 mods not working issue disappear, it will be sure that this issue is caused by the household problem. You can give up the original household and use the new one.
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
After you've launched the game, the folder will be in Documents/Electronic Arts -- then inside the Sims 4 folder you'll find the Mods folder along with all the other folders needed. You don't have to start a game save, just go to the opening main menu screen then go up to Options (the three dots in the upper right corner of the screen) and select Exit Game.
