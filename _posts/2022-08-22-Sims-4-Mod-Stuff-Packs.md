The Sims 4 is a great game, in part because of its thriving mod community. You can use mods to give your Sims eyelashes, expand your makeup options, or get luxurious new furniture. You can even alter the fundamental gameplay, and here are the 7 essential mods that will let you do just that.
That’s everything you need to know about Sims 4 custom content. If you’re looking for general Sims 4 mods, we’ve got an excellent guide for that. We’ve also got a Sims 4 cheats list if you’re looking for some help running your sim’s lives. Failing that, why not read up on what we want from The Sims 5, should Maxis decide to give us another iteration.
Rounding out the list of best places to start looking for Sims 4 mods is Sims 4 Updates, a plain and well-organised website that features easy-to-access download categories, and a constantly updating front page you can scroll through. Each day there are new pieces to browse, with streamlined posts giving you inspiration at a glance.
But with The Sims 4 game being five years old already, there's tons of custom content out there to choose from. So which ones are worth downloading? Which ones are trash? Here are 10 fantastic fan-made custom content mod pack and stuff packs to help players get the absolutely maxim amount of enjoyment from their Sims 4 games.

## Some popular mods include mods that change the appearance of your sims, mods that add new objects and furniture, and mods that let you control the actions of other sims.

Mods: Modifications that can change the way the game and Sims behave. These can range from minor game changes to large system overhauls. These often need to be checked for updates more than custom content in order to keep working, and can sometimes become incompatible with the game after official updates.
Given how easy it is to mod Sims 4, the scene is robust. It’s easy to get overwhelmed and not be able to find what you’re looking for. This will be the first in a series about the essential Sims mods that most players will find useful, and I’ve tested all these mods to make sure none of them conflict with each other. To begin with, I’m looking at mods that change the way the game works. Some do some fine-tuned background work. Others overhaul core systems. All of them make The Sims 4 even more fun.
Many of the best Sims 4 mods affect the ways Sims interact with each other. The Sims 4 has a long list of traits that change the way a Sim behaves, and because they’re relatively easy for modders to create you can quickly expand that list through custom content.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
With so many impressive Sims 4 mods out there, choosing the best ones is no easy task. Some of them fix common gameplay issues, while others add more depth to your Sims' stories. Whether you're looking for more cheats or just want to turn your Sims' world into a horror movie, there's something for everyone!
Unlike other modding websites, Mod The Sims also goes a step further by providing players with handy bug fixes, tweaks and other patches to help change Sim behaviours and make the game more playable. You can certainly still find content like new hair and makeup here too, but patches are extremely handy and Mod The Sims is one of few websites that offer them.
There are also lots of automatic settings geared towards letting non-controlled Sims live full lives without you, getting married and having babies of their own volition, and you can also use the mod to adjust the in-game time settings so your Sims don’t take half a day to shower and have breakfast. If you only grab one mod, make it this one.
For mod fans who really want to get into the nitty-gritty details of playing The Sims then check out the MC Command Centre mega-mod by Deaderpool. This mod is a collection of smaller mods that give you the power to make small adjustments and tweaks to how sims live their lives.
