If you ever wished to turn The Sims 4 into a true murder mod show, then you’ve come to the right place!

But, that won’t be a bad thing once you see how perfect this mod is!
"Extreme Violence," commonly referred to as the "Murder Mod," is a fanmade mod for The Sims 4 that turns the game's tame "Teen" ESRB Rating into "M" or worse, depending on the user's preference. Created by a community user named "SACRIFICIAL," the Murder Mod adds a variety of new violent features to the Sims 4 world, including a bare-handed heart removal, embracing backstabs, head-bashing, and even the supernatural act of hurling a helicopter into a crowd of NPCs in The Sims 4. Needless to say, the Murder Mod is not recommended to those faint of heart or are sensitive to controversial content such as violence towards children and other heinous activities involving gore and brutal mutilation.
But, murder mod doesn’t have to be all about murdering! Non-deadly interactions are also included, like slapping or kicking a Sim. Basically, you can get in a really good fight without having to murder someone. Extreme Violence, with all of its features enabled, is a fantastic mod that anyone should try! And in case this Sims 4 murder mod is not working for you, check out our general Mods and CC guide.
