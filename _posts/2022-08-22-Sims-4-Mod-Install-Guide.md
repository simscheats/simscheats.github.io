## Find and install mods for the sims 4.

Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.

Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
Not everyone is satisfied with how The Sims 4 operates by default, and you may want to change up your game a bit to make it more exciting or lifelike. In that case, you might decide to install mods to your game. This wikiHow will teach you how to add mods to The Sims 4.
Next, launch The Sims 4. Now ask yourself, “What mods do I want to discard?” To figure out which mods you want to keep from these packs, find an empty lot on the world menu and select “Build.” It can be any empty lot. Once loaded into your empty lot, start placing the custom content onto the lot.

Go to your Mods folder and right-click it. Again, copy it to your Desktop. Once you're sure you have a copy of your Mods folder on your Desktop, go ahead and delete the copy in your Sims 4 folder. Restart your game and play it for a few minutes. If your game runs without crashing or having errors, you know the issue is with one of your Mods. If it doesn't, you'll need to go out and repair your game (and the issue is something within your Sims 4 game itself).
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
That's the basics on how to install mods and custom content for The Sims 4, as well as how to troubleshoot, uninstall and keep your Mods folder organised! Got any questions or suggestions that I haven't covered above? Feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to help!
Custom content and general mods: These files end in .package. Open the Mod folder the game has created (Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods) and copy all the mod files into the folder. You can create additional subfolders to organize your growing mod collection better.

## How to uninstall mods from the sims 4.

To reset your mods folder for Sims 4, open the “My Documents” folder, and then open the “Electronic Arts” folder. Inside the “Electronic Arts” folder, you’ll find a file called “S4_Mods_Default.” Open this file and delete all of the files inside of it.
@SantaFeAtBay You can delete the mods fully by opening your Sims 4 folder in My Documents and in the mod folder delete all mods, in your case you can just delete the entire folder. You will then need to clear the Sims 4 cache which you can do by deleting the file localthumbscache.package which is the folder in which your Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/ cache can be found.You also need to delete all files that end in .cache but leave the actual directory. Now go ahead and go back to thecachestr folder. Delete all of the files but once again do not delete the actual directory.If you see a folder called onlinethumbnailcache then you can go ahead and trash it too.
If your mods are not functioning properly in Sims 4, there are some free tools created by the modding community that will help you find and delete the files. The process can be tedious, but the best way is using Sims 4 Studio (a free tool for making custom content) and Sims 4 Tray Importer.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
There are a few ways to get your mods back. If you installed them manually, you can find the downloads folder in your game’s install directory. If you installed them using the Sims 4 Store, you can find the downloads folder in your game’s “Documents” folder.
Mods for Sims 4 can give you amazing gaming experience, but if they’re not working properly, they can create unexpected problems. Broken mods can even cause Sims 4 not to launch. When you’re having problems with mods, one of the solutions is to delete the mods. In this post, I’ll show you how to delete mods from your Mods folder step by step. It’s easy and quick.
There are a few ways to uninstall mods. The most common way is to go to the mod’s installation directory (usually found in your Steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Data\ folder) and delete the files that were installed with the mod. Another way is to use the “Uninstall” option in the game’s launcher.
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.
