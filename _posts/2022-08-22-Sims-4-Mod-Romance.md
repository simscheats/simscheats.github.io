## Sims 4 mod romance allows players to create custom romances between different sims in the game.

This mod is perfect if you are fed up with stacking the flirt interaction into your sims queue. The passionate romance mod adds an array of new romantic interactions to bring some variety to your gameplay. This also comes with a romantic reputation system, an attraction, and crush system, and reintroduces the classic ‘goose’ interaction from the sims 2.
