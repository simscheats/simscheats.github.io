## A mod that will kill sims in the game.

This is an honestly wild mod that every sims player needs to try at least once in their gameplay. It isn’t for the faint of heart because the interactions are pretty gruesome and scary so you may not want to participate, it’s really up to you. Happy playing!

This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
There are a lot of incredible mods out there that you can download and be able to completely change your game and make it a little darker than EA intended. You can even download a murder mod for The Sims 4, which is of course, the Extreme Violence Mod that was created by Sacrificial Mods.
The Sims4modding community offers players a huge variety of ways to alter their games - for every mod meant to improve the lives of Sims, there is bound to be one about making their lives worse. Many players are always looking for new ways to torture or kill their characters in The Sims 4, a fact which many modders are keenly aware of. Whether players are looking to torture and terrorize Sims emotionally or physically, there's a mod that can help.
Of course, we’re talking about the Extreme Violence mod. This is a fantastic extension that allows all kinds of murders to happen in the game. You can run a Sim over with your car, you can shoot them with a gun, you can choke them to death… And everything else in between. There are actually a dozen “fun”, or rather unique ways of ending a Sim’s life. So, don’t be afraid to mess around and try out new stuff.

This first mod comes from creator SACRIFICIAL - one of the most prominent modders when it comes to creating new ways to torture Sims - and can be downloaded from the main SACRIFICIAL downloads hub. This mod is meant to interject random tragedy into Sims' lives, with one of the main features being a collection of serial killers that can be made active within the game. These killers will autonomously inhabit neighborhoods and may kill player Sims who get on their bad side. Alternatively, players can also befriend the serial killer or become one themselves. Other possible tragedies that can randomly occur include kidnapping, robbery, and deadly illness.
One of such mods is the Extreme Violence mod, which adds a hefty dose of real-world realism and horror slasher themes into any happy-go-lucky Sims neighborhood. It's a pretty big mod to download, so it's important that players know how to download the Extreme Violence mod in Sims 4 to avoid the game from breaking.
Gangs are also part of this mod and you can join one to gain more benefits. A gang can protect you from attackers and kill on your behalf. Every gang can have its own outfits and you can modify your gang’s look too. Also, you can have a gang vs. gang war on the streets if you’ve harassed or killed a member of an opposing gang. In the end, you get fame points by killing Sim, so you can become a notorious figure in the world by ending Sims’ lives.
For those that want their Sim to be able to terrorize others, this cannibalism mod from creator necrodogmtsands4s is a unique take on evil mods. It essentially makes a new form of Supernatural in The Sims 4, similar to magic-based witches or vampires. Sims can be converted to cannibals through the use of a Cannibal Altar, and from then on will have glowing red eyes and a special plumbob.

## A mod that will add a new death mechanic to the game.

The mod was created with care and precision. It’s loaded with many amazing features. It doesn’t matter if you want to unleash a worldwide swath of chaos or be one day a hitman or James Bond, now you can! Become that serial murderer you’ve been wanting to become!
Something that most mod creators do these days is create incredible trailers for their mods so you can get a real feel for what may be included and see if it’s something that you may enjoy. The extreme violence mod trailer is awesome and you can view it below!
It's not a mod for the faint of heart or for younger players, so older gamers should use caution if they share their PC or game with younger audiences. For the full list of features, refer to Sacrificial Mod's website where the mod can be downloaded from.
There are so many big things you can do with this mod that will be discussed in the next few sections, but I want to first talk about some of the smaller aspects of the mod that most players may overlook that are really good and add a lot to the gameplay.
Depending on your choices, you’ll lean towards good or evil, which changes the type of spells you can cast. Do-gooders can eventually bring ghosts back to life, but if that doesn’t sound like fun, just set fire to a table instead. If you’re bored of your current playthrough, then this is bound to liven it up.
First of all, the police are included in this mod and there are cops roaming around, looking for killers. You’ll have to be careful when performing a murder unless you want to be thrown in jail. The cops are smart and can notice blood stains and acquire additional information about the murder. But you have the freedom to turn this feature off if you don’t want cops messing around with your work.
