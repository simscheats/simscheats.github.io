## This sims 4 mod gives players the ability to be a sugar baby, working to help others achieve their life goals.

Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.

Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.
I’d definitely advise you to stay away from mods like Wonderful Whims if you’re below 18 years old. Some of the content you may counter could be dangerous and harmful, so keep that in mind. As much as we want to bring The Sims 4 closer to reality, sometimes it’s simply better not to do that.
The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience. Although the game is fun enough on its own (there's plenty of stuff you can do in The Sims 4 already), it gets even better when you're able to have more meaningful conversations, or fix the lag that's been bothering you. We selected some of the handiest, most entertaining, and most beautiful Sims 4 mods out there. Check the list to see which ones you like best, and you can install them right away!
With so many impressive Sims 4 mods out there, choosing the best ones is no easy task. Some of them fix common gameplay issues, while others add more depth to your Sims' stories. Whether you're looking for more cheats or just want to turn your Sims' world into a horror movie, there's something for everyone!

This mod is excellent for those of you who want to add a little spice to your game. You get all the fun stuff out of a relationship (wink, wink) without having to deal with a clingy partner constantly calling you to hang out. It allows your sims to explore and have fun, without having to commit to anything serious.
This is a version of the popular challenge that is normally meant for traditional sims 4 gameplay. However, this is edited and altered for simblrs who post their stories on certain outlets like tumblr, wordpress, etc. who enjoy creating visual stories with The Sims.
The ability to follow your kids to school (in the least creepy way possible) was always a nice touch in the previous game, as you could actually get a little closer to what they spent their time in class doing. Well, with the As long as you've got the Get to Work Sims 4 expansion, you can download Zerbu's Go to School mod (opens in new tab) that means you can actually follow your children to school and help them achieve their education, learn from a teacher NPC and even visit the counsellor for a spirit boost. Kids can also earn Emblems from the principal, which they can redeem later in life for reward traits.
This one is super handy if you add random NPC Sims to your world. Without the Life Decider mod by KawaiiStacie (opens in new tab), NPC Sims will have no career, no income, and zero skills. If you don't want to manually stir every Sim towards a certain career or don't want to fill out their skillset, this mod will do it for you. It comes with a bunch of interesting bonus traits too, such as a sweet tooth, a drinking problem, or bad cooking skills.

## This sims 4 mod allows players to take on the role of a sugar baby, working to help others achieve their life goals.

The Sims 4 base game comes with minimal amounts of drama, sure you can cheat on your partner or fight the old lady down the street, but what about when you want really juicy storylines. Drama mods are perfect for creating in-depth storylines and truly fleshing out your characters, it adds a sense of reality to sometimes unrealistic gameplay. This list will countdown the top 10 best drama mods.
Anyone who’s ever played the sims knows what Woohoo is, and probably knows the fear of your parents walking in while the Sims 2 woohoo cutscenes played. Sims 4 is much more PG, a quick pixelated romp in the bed, or shower, and the deed is done. This mod overhauls the woohoo system to make it a bit more realistic.
Toddlers are usually not the most interesting people in the Sims 4. They eat, they sleep, and they play. Quite innocently. However, the Deadly Toddlers mod from Sacrificial Mods (opens in new tab) will change all that. Your Sims' kids might still look cute, but they will burn you alive or stab you in the neck the first chance they get. This may sound a little weird (and perhaps a bit disturbing), but this mod makes life in the Sims 4 a lot more exciting!
Your sim has to level up their social popularity points, the higher they are, the more situations they can help with. You can send your sims to social events to gain points, and help friends, all while looking after the rest of the sims in your household. These social events include protesting against issues such as animal abuse, bullying, or supporting the LGBTQA+ community.
Hey guys, I came up with this Legacy Challenge to celebrate 5 years of The Sims 4 and will be starting to play this off-screen soon. I may update on my YouTube as a current household and I’m planning to post some of my gameplay to my tumblr – phdsimmeroffscreen.
Sugar Daddies and Mommies can send gifts to their Sugar Babies! It will increase their romantic relationship and also leave a chance that your Sugar Baby will show up at your house all dressed up and flirty to say thank you! (The object is not send to the Sim (the game does not allow this) it's just get destroyed after you pick it in the picker.)
'Ask for Daily Allowance' interaction will earn your Baby simoleons. You can ask every 12 hours and as long as your Daddy or Mommy is in a good mood they will grant it to you. Amount of money your Sugar Baby gets depends on the wealth of their Sugar Partner! I know everyone has their own opinion on how much money in Sims is a lot of money, but I stopped on in-game wealth distribution system, so everyone could comfortably play. There are 3 levels of wealth based on total cash Sim has: the lowest level is Sims who have less than 10000 simoleons in cash; middle level is Sims who have more than 10000 simoleons, but less than 30000; and highest level is Sims who have more than 30000 simoleons in cash.
Deciding your Sims' weight and muscle mass is as easy as moving a slider or pushing their bodies around in The Sims 4, but isn't it weird that every single person in your world is the same height? Unnatural right? Well, this height slider Sims 4 mod from GODJUL1 (opens in new tab) fixes all of that, adding natural stature variations to your neighbourhoods.
