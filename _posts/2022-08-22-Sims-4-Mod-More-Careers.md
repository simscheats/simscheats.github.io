## The sims 4 has a brand new career system, which lets you choose from a variety of different careers.

With multiple expansions and game packs, Sims 4 now has over a dozen careers that players can choose to bring in money and give their sims a purpose in their digital lives. Each career has a set path of progression for promotion, typically culminating in a high-level job that brings in lots of money, helpful bonuses, and in some cases access to additional skills and abilities outside of work.

The careers available in The Sims 4 base game are fine to begin with, but once you’ve been playing for a while, they are less than extensive. If you have been finding the career options a little boring, these mods are perfect for you! Here are my top 15 favorite career mods to add some variation into your game.
Updated By Benjamin Baker On February 10th 2020: With the number of updates and DLC that have released since this article was first written, it seemed appropriate to go back and revisit the career options in Sims 4. Honestly, not much has changed in the top 10 spots, but there have been some upsets at lower levels. If you’ve exhausted the best options on recent playthroughs and want to try something different, here are some other careers you should definitely take a look at.
There really aren’t many jobs in The Sims 4, especially if you only have the base game and this can lead to not having a lot of options for storytelling. We get the basics like a business career and an athletic career, but to get anything more interesting you’re going to need to own some DLC.
The Sims 4 offer a lot of opportunities for careers, professions, and ambitions. There are many mods that allow The Sims 4 players to experience new careers or professions in the game, but some of them are better than others. In this article, I give a list of some of the best CC packs for Sims 4 job and career mods. Enjoy!

## There are different career paths which will let you build your dream career.

One thing that makes this career better than other professions is that it doesn’t take a lot of time to progress in it – unlike careers like being a business owner where you have to wait for your business reputation to be restored after each promotion. You can install it from this page.
Surprisingly, the Stylist branch of the Style Influencer Career pays a lot more than the Trend Setter branch. Both branches need a bunch of Skills to get promoted like Writing, Painting, and Charisma. They're mostly the same, but the Stylist branch will unlock some interactions earlier than the second branch.
In addition to decent pay and a standard workload you can spend your free time working on documentaries and submitting grant applications that can bring in some residual income on top of your salary. If you’re looking for stability and some nice side income this is a great career.
This is an excellent career mod because it includes seven nursing specialties, each of which may be followed to acquire a graduate degree in nursing such as nursing manager, surgical nurse, and nursing educator. Just like you would as a real-life nurse.
There are two branches of this career: art curator or art dealer. As an art curator, you’ll pick the perfect pieces to hang in museums and art galleries. As an art dealer, you’ll work at art auctions, install artwork, and even invest in artwork to later sell and make a profit!
Event planners are a huge business and help people celebrate the biggest parts of their lives like weddings, birthdays and anniversaries. The key to this career is being talented in tons of different skills so you can truly impress others and get their business. You’ll, of course, need to earn the charisma skillbut you’re also going to be working on things like writing, logic and dancing.
Double check cheats are enabled in your game. Press control +shift + c (command on Mac). In the text field, type testingcheats true (or testingcheats on ). While you're there, may as well add bb.ignoregameplayunlocksentitlement to unlock all special career objects and rewards regardless of your chosen path.
Both branches of the Style Influencer have a decent salary compared to the rest of the Careers: Trend Setter is one of them. Players will be able to choose one when they reach level five in the Style Influencer Career. This branch is perfect for Simmers who like inventing different clothing styles.
