With so many impressive Sims 4 mods out there, choosing the best ones is no easy task. Some of them fix common gameplay issues, while others add more depth to your Sims' stories. Whether you're looking for more cheats or just want to turn your Sims' world into a horror movie, there's something for everyone!
You can find many mods over at ModTheSims, which hosts a wealth of community-made free mods for you to download and enjoy as you please. Installing mods is simple enough – all you need to do is drag the mod files over to the game’s mod folder. In a typical setup, this should be Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.
I remember downloading a free trial of Sims 4 and being really disappointed with it. Some of the mods sound like they should be included in the game already, such as the MC Command Center. However, reading this has gotten me all nostalgic for the older games, so I might give Sims 4 a try and keep these mods bookmarked to add after playing the original version for a bit. Thanks for the information.
The list of possible Sims 4 mods is basically endless. You can spend hours and hours looking through various websites, trying to find out whether a given mod is useful or just a waste of time. Over dozens of hours, we’ve tested a plethora of mods and hand-picked the ones most worthy of your attention. Through some trial and error, we’ve also listed which mods contradict each other and won’t function if both are installed at the same time.

You just need to look at the game’s strong library of user generated content to see what’s really keeping the lights on. The Sims 4 mods scene is thriving, with plenty of weird and wonderful additions to the base game. We’ve compiled a list of what we think are the best Sims 4 mods accompanied with links to all the download pages. Be sure to read the install instructions for each mod.
But with so many different mods to choose from, and so many talented creators out there making cool things, it can be hard to work out which are actually worth installing. That’s where we can help. We’ve done the work for you by hand-selecting five of the best The Sims 4 mods which will revitalize your game completely.
Fortunately, alongside these officially-developed packs, there is a huge modding community for The Sims 4. The mods allow you to further customize your world - or even fix current bugs in the game. Some mods, such as the Private School add-on, are family-friendly and can be used by all players, whilst adult supervision will definitely be required for the likes of Life’s Tragedies. Whether you want to tag along with your Sim as they head off to school or break out the spellbooks to pursue witchcraft as a career, Sims mods add exciting new angles to everyday gameplay, even deeper than messing with things using The Sims 4 cheats.
There's a mod called Wicked Whims that is pretty adult-themed but has a fair share of great tweaks that makes each sim in The Sims 4 all the more believable. Players who just want the family-friendly content present in this game should check out Wonderful Whims instead.

## Sims 4 mods can improve your gameplay experience.

Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience. Although the game is fun enough on its own (there's plenty of stuff you can do in The Sims 4 already), it gets even better when you're able to have more meaningful conversations, or fix the lag that's been bothering you. We selected some of the handiest, most entertaining, and most beautiful Sims 4 mods out there. Check the list to see which ones you like best, and you can install them right away!
Modder Zero has a huge archive of free gameplay mods that are incredibly useful for expanding play in The Sims 4. Whether that’s improving upon Spellcasters, Ghosts, and Vampires, expanding Aliens into Time Lords from Doctor Who, or tweaking autonomy actions for your Sims, there’s a whole lot to choose from.
Sims 4 has come a long way in improving certain aspects of the game that had long been forgotten by its predecessors. One of such features is the overhauled personality system. Despite the massive improvements, you will still find yourself wanting to make further improvements to the system. That is where this excellent mod comes in.
This has made the game tenfold more fun for me. Sims emotions are much less predictable and you have to work that much harder to figure out how to make them happy. The mod includes an in-game tutorial as well as an in-game setting menu that lets you pick and choose the features you want in your game. I would recommend first going through the in-game tutorial before customizing your settings menu to get a good feel for the things you do and don’t want in your game.
If you've ever thought that the parenting options in The Sims 4 are a little bit thin on the ground, this is most definitely a mod that you need to download. From a creator named Caradriel, Better Babies and Toddlers does exactly what it says on the tin – it makes major improvements in the baby and toddler department.
This mod isn't one that just makes your game slightly more realistic, it also helps to make your game a lot more fun. Currently, Sims take quite a while to do just about anything. But with this mod, at least one part of their life is sped up dramatically.
Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.
