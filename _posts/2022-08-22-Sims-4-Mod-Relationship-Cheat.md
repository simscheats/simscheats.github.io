## How to get sims to like each other more quickly using cheat codes.

We have the main guide to cheats page here (click) that has all the cheats plus instructions on how to cheat and what to do if you can't get cheats to work.I am assuming you aren't able to make the friendship cheats work..so, the two target sims must have had a conversation face-to-face at least once...so they need to have been introduced. Once you have introduced them you can now pause your game and use the cheats to make them best friends.For Example: I have a sim named John Smith and Mary Dear. This is the exact cheat to make them friends:pause game, testingcheats on followed by modifyrelationship John Smith Mary Dear 100 LTR_Friendship_mainYou must use the correct names of the target sims in your game.

Sometimes it can be very difficult for you to find sims to be friends with and just want to create a sim out of the blue to be your sim’s friend. You can use this cheat to make that happen so easily! First you’ll want to make sure that your cheats are enabled and the cheat box is open.
A related cheat code that you may want to use is the ability to a dd or remove sims from your family which is super easy.

You need to wait for 10 hours until their negative emotions have passed before you can try to patch things up between them.
Once cheats are enabled, enter any of the following phrases in the box that appears to activate the related effect.

The second part, [sim 1’s first name] [sim 1’s last name] [sim 2’s first name] [sim 2’s last name] is where you should put the names of the two Sims you want to affect their relationship. For example, if your Sims are called Sandy Martin and David Willow, then those are the names you should put into the cheat instead of “sim 1’s first name…” and so on. It doesn’t matter which Sim goes first, so only worry about spelling their names right.
modifyrelationship YourSimFirstName YourSimLastName TargetSimFirstName TargetSimLastName X LTR_Friendship_Main – This will increase the friendship level of two Sims. You need to replace the ‘X’ in the cheat above with a number between -100 and 100 to set the friendship level to that amount between the two Sims you’ve entered the names of.
Once this is open, you just need to type the commands and press enter. We will use the ModifyRelationship YourSimFirstname YourSimLastname Sim2Firstname Sims2LastName # Relationship_Type - see below for explanations. Testing Cheats can be off for these but you may try turning them on if you have trouble.
