To help you navigate what's on offer, here’s a lineup of the best Sims 4 mods, from the little tweaks, to the digital life-changers. Make sure to read the installation section, and double check for any conflicts to make sure you’re not running two that will butt heads.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
Many of the best Sims 4 mods affect the ways Sims interact with each other. The Sims 4 has a long list of traits that change the way a Sim behaves, and because they’re relatively easy for modders to create you can quickly expand that list through custom content.
Sims 4 has come a long way in improving certain aspects of the game that had long been forgotten by its predecessors. One of such features is the overhauled personality system. Despite the massive improvements, you will still find yourself wanting to make further improvements to the system. That is where this excellent mod comes in.

I’m Tatiana AKA HarmonySims/Simlish and Dreams on Tumblr. I’ve always been interested in graphic design, photography, and computers. I played Sims Freeplay for years before discovering Sims 3. An obsession was born when I pushed myself to become a better builder and learned how to make CC and mods for Sims 4.
“Get a Job!” it’s a phrase you have heard all too often. With this mod, you can add a plethora of interesting and custom careers like a tattoo artist, stockbroker, game developer and so on. The developers are always adding new careers so getting yourself a new job is not going to be hard.
Don’t be too quick to choose the craziest errand to send your sim. Based on the activity you send them out to, their skills and motives will change so you need to pick carefully. The mod also allows you to “explore” with another character to further build relations.
These next tattoos are such a must-have in my game and are so much fun. Getting words tattooed on your body is extremely common but we can’t do them in english because sims speak simlish! These are so much fun and add words all over your sim’s body in interesting locations.
