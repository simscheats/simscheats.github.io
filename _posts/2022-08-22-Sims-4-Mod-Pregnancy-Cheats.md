## There are a variety of sims 4 mod pregnancy cheats you can use to get pregnant almost instantly.

In The Sims 4, there are (currently) only 2 ways for a Sim to get pregnant. One is during alien abductions, and another is through a special Woohoo option that shows up when your Sim has a high enough relationship with their partner. In the real world the status of a relationship doesn't necessarily have anything to do with having a baby, and the Risky Woohoo mod, by PolarBearSims, adds a bit more realism (and surprise) to pregnancy.
