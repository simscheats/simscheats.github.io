## There is a mod available that removes the eyelashes from sims 4.

And keep in mind that the mod doesn’t instantly remove all eyelashes from all of your Sims. Instead, you’ll have to do the work manually and individually for every Sim. Any time you want to remove eyelashes from a Sim, simply open the CAS menu and select the eyelashes remover.

There is nothing wrong with eyelashes, right? BUT we do have a problem with the way eyelashes appear in The Sims 4, don’t we? I mean, they look nothing like human eyelashes, for starters. And the best way to describe them is to say that they’re just big black lines on top of our Sims’ eyes! Luckily for us, there is a great eyelash remover mod for Sims 4 that can help us out!
The eyelash remover mod that most of us use in Sims 4 is simply called EA Eyelashes Remover MOD. It’s entirely developed by kijiko, whom we regularly feature here in SnootySims. She’s done some incredible mods and CC for the game, especially eyelashes and eyeliners! And the eyelash remover mod is another popular mod in the community, simply because it’s so useful.
Once you install the mod, head over to the CAS menu and select the Sim you want to remove the eyelashes from. Go into the Skin Detail category and scroll down until you find kijiko’s mod. Her name should be on the eyelashes remover. And if you select it, it will instantly remove the eyelashes.
On its best day, Sims 4 needs a ton of eyelashes CC so we could make our Sims’ eyes look at least decent. Back when the game was released (in 2014), its visuals were totally satisfying. But now, we need custom content to make our Sims look modern and realistic.

Kijiko actually runs a Tumblr blog, and that’s her official page. Simply scroll down until you find the EA Eyelashes Remover MOD and click on the green “Download” button. Then the downloading will start automatically, and you’ll have the contents in no time.
