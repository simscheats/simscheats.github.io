## Create subfolders for your mods.

If you want to have Sub-folders in you mods folder make sure you have the file Resource.cfg. And if you don't you can create one using Notepad++ And you would type everything like this Priority 500 PackedFile *.package PackedFile */*.package PackedFile */*/*.package PackedFile */*/*/*.package PackedFile */*/*/*/*.package PackedFile */*/*/*/*/*.package

I have a lot of Gameplay mods; since many of them are script mods and can‚Äôt be more than 1 subfolder deep in order to work, I organize them by creator to make it easier to keep track and update them. Any miscellaneous mods go in the ‚ÄúGameplay/Build/CAS Mods‚Äù folders.
For game mods, I tend to sort into folders by the Creator because this makes it so much easier to update on patch days. Stuff like TOOL, Better Build Buy and W Whims are in their own folders as per the installation instructions. Then I have additional folders for Creators plus a "Miscellaneous Mods" for one off ones
Or do this:
You have your "mods" folder with all the mods that you know are good and error free, but now you want to add another mod to it.
Rename your "mods" folder to "mods1" and make a new "mods" folder with the new mod, and ONLY that mod, put in it, so when you start a game, if there's any problems with the new mod, you'll know right away about it.
Forgot to mention after you delete the mods folder then run your game as normal and it will create the Resource.cfg. and then you can exit the game and copy all your custom content and mods back into the mods folder.. Before you do that you can create folders to keep things organized. But keep scripts and mods in the main folder and just put the custom content into folders

Now you are able to go five sub-folders deep in your mods folder. I suggest that you keep all your mods on the top level and only use the sub-folders for your custom content. Many mods (especially those that are zipped) need to be on the top level. How you organize at this point is really up to you but I will show you how mine looks to give you an idea. I like to organize my folder by what it is and then the creator. So for example my path to a shoes by Madlen would look like this: C:\Users\****\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods\Custom Content\Clothing\Madlen
This way I can more easily pinpoint if some mod needs to be removed. Heavy script mods like mc command center and ui cheats should also be in their separate folders so you can easily move them from your mods folder whenever they release a new patch as these mods tends to break with every new patch.
I use TS4 Mod Manager, which I think I got from Nexus, but I can't remember. It makes it really easy to turn specific CC on and off. I used to have folders for basically every type just as others do. You can specify folders in the Mod Manager, too, which makes it easy to locate. However, for several months I turned all CC off and only just got back into using it.. and I haven't organized any of it. It's a bit overwhelming, but I think most creators make it obvious in the CC name what the CC actually is, so that helps.
I‚Äôll
explain how I do it from there. After sorting all your content in
different folders for merging, I move all the newly created sub
folder into a backup folder, with the same organisation as the main
folder, with a CAS and BUY folder. This is how my main mod folder
and the backup folder look after merging the files.

## Organize your mods in a sensible way.

A quick little side note: It is important to organize your mods folder because if you are like me, you have over a thousand packages. If you are like many of my Simming friends, you have thousands of packages. Now imagine if there is a repeat of the ‚ÄúDay the Mods and Custom Content All Broke‚Äù. Remember that day? Remember the nightmare it was to figure out what broke? By having your mods folder organized, it facilitates the trouble shooting process. Instead of hunting and pecking and hoping you found it? You simply remove a few folders at a time, testing your game, till you no longer have their error. It‚Äôs that simple.
I hope that all this reading was worth it for you, and that this
guide will help you to better organize your content.¬†if you have any question to ask, or have some other tips you want to share, don‚Äôt hesitate, I can always edit this guide to add more information.
The best way I've found to keep them organized is to have every single script/gameplay mod or any mod in general in the main mods folder, that way if the game breaks you have a shorter list to check, and then depending on how you play you can start adding subfolders with some main categories, the two main ones I have are CAS and BM and as those folders grew I divided them into batches, which is just the amount of files that I could possibly manage without feeling overwhelmed by the overall amount in a single folder, this is usually 300-500 files for me. I also keep general main folders that have CAS and BM inside them such as a modern one or a historical one, that way I can simply swap those two and I wont be loading cc that I wont be using.
When I first started getting serious about CC I went looking for something to help me get started, and I‚Äôm so happy I found this. It takes a lot of the effort out of figuring out these category trees yourself! It‚Äôs not a mod, it‚Äôs just a simple collection of empty folders to help you organize your CC more effectively. It comes in a couple different flavours based on what your CC-hoarding game is like, and of course, you can make any changes/edits to it you like. Use it as a starting point, then build your perfect Mods folder from there.
I didn‚Äôt know how badly I needed this until I found it. This mod does a LOT of things to help you keep a healthy Mods folder, such as letting you know when mod errors occur, and telling you about any issues such as duplicate CC or possibly outdated mods. Super useful, I recommend it to anyone who has a heavily modded game!
When I first started downloading CC I was so serious and over-organized; I'd keep an excel document with every CC I downloaded, their thumbnail, download link, creator, etc. Needless to say, this took more time than actually playing the game and using the CC. Nowadays I use folders in the Mods folder. I create one for each creator I download content from, and within their folders, I have other folders for CAS (clothes, accessories, and so on), BUILD, complete set-folders if I download a whole set, etc.
If you‚Äôre me and this bothers you to no end, you end up spending hours changing the Sort Order for each piece of CC yourself by hand using CASTools. You put on a podcast, zone out, and start opening packages, changing numbers, and saving files. It takes forever, and you wonder if it‚Äôs really worth it. üòµüò©
I wanted to talk to you about organizing your Sims 4 folders. I‚Äôm one of those people who likes everything nice and tidy, including my Sims 4 folders. So, I wanted to show you how I organize my folder. This will be done in multiple articles with the first one covering the mods folder.
