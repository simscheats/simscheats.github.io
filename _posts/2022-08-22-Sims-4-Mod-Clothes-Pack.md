Creating a Sim is much more advanced than before! Before you just had the basics, now you have many more options to create the Sim to look excatly like you choose. Now you can manipulate any body part including the abdomen, chest, legs, arms, and feet. Each Sim is also able to have more wardrobes per category; everyday wear, formal wear, sleepwear, and athletic wear.
This option does not exist in The Sims. Wardrobes in The Sims have a "Change clothes" option which allows a player to change a Sim's Everyday skin, so long as the Sim is wearing Everyday clothes. (At times, it may be necessary to have the Sim "Change to Normal" before the option will appear, even if he or she appears to be wearing Everyday clothes.) The player will be able to choose from all Everyday clothes, both Maxis-made and custom, which are made for the Sim's age, gender, body type, and skin tone.
