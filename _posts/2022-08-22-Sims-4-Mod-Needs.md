I remember downloading a free trial of Sims 4 and being really disappointed with it. Some of the mods sound like they should be included in the game already, such as the MC Command Center. However, reading this has gotten me all nostalgic for the older games, so I might give Sims 4 a try and keep these mods bookmarked to add after playing the original version for a bit. Thanks for the information.
