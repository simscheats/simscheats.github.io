## How to start a sims 4 mod boxing career.

In The Sims 4, fights can be started by Sims who have a very negative relationship with someone. They can also be started by any sims if the holiday is "Neighborhood Brawl". [TS4:S] Like in previous games, the fight is obscured by a cloud of smoke. Sims who lose a fight will become dazed, while Sims who win become confident. Sims with the squeamish trait will become uncomfortable after having a fight. Children can also get into a fight with each other.

You'll need to compete at the amateur level before turning professional. Most boxers start training at a young age at a local boxing gym, participating in local and national tournaments from the age of eight on. Performing well at competitions such as the Golden Gloves of America tournament – a high profile competition that showcases the best amateur boxers – can lead to international selection and may open up opportunities for you to be signed by professional boxing promoters who will then arrange pro fights for you.
This is the same as getting an amateur boxing licence, only – you’ll have to register with one of the four major professional organisations (WBA, WBC, WBO, and IBF). The process is generally similar, so we don’t need to explain it in detail. A professional licence is the basic prerequisite for a professional career, but once you’re done with it, you can easily continue and start climbing up the ranks.
Now that you’ve solved all the prerequisites, you can commence your training. Boxing training is very specific so we are not going to teach you how you should train – we’ll leave something for your coach – but we can state here that you’ll have to work a lot and on a lot of elements to become great. Amateur boxing is not as demanding as professional boxing, but you’ll still need to give it everything you got to achieve something.
At this point, you'll need to be licensed by your state's athletic commission. All pro boxers and some amateurs must be licensed before they can participate in a professional bout. Requirements vary, but typically you'll have to show that you are an experienced boxer of good moral character. The state will require medical tests such as neurological examinations, blood work and an EKG to prove you are physically and mentally fit to fight.

Before you start with actual bouts, you’ll have to get an amateur licence. The rules depend on the jurisdiction – a lot of organisations have their own rules and although they are probably not that different, they may have some specific requirements you’ll have to fulfil, so be sure to inform yourselves about everything.
Now that we’ve told you what professional boxing is, let us see the general steps you need to take before becoming a professional boxer. Before becoming a professional boxer, you’ll need to become an amateur boxer so we’ll see the steps necessary to become an amateur before we deal with the steps needed for the pro level. We’ll walk you through the process step by step so you can see what and when you need to do.
Finding a gym is the necessary prerequisite since all boxing careers start in the gym. When choosing a gym, you have to be very careful to pick the right one, because not all gyms will offer you what you need to start a boxing career. Sure, if you want to be a recreational boxer, any gym that has a boxing programme will do, but if you really want to devote yourself to the sport, you’ll have to find a good gym.
Amateur boxing organisations usually require a brief and basic physical exam, whose point is to determine whether you’re of sound mind and body to participate in competitions. It is truly very basic procedure (blood pressure, reflexes, heart rate, any past concussions or hand injuries, but no X-rays, brain scans, or other advanced screening types of procedures) so you needn’t worry yourselves.

## How to be a successful sims 4 mod boxer.

In this Sims 4 fighting mod, the pro fighters resemble those of the UFC. They get to show their natural talent for combat and earn glory. Each time you play through this career you can advance to multiple phases, all the way from having a debut match to becoming a champion or going into retirement.
For example, this Sims 4 fighting mod introduces gangs and gang wars, martial arts, and sword fighting! Your Sims can also hurt themselves and even commit suicide. You can turn Sims 4 into the ultimate place where there is everything from a fight club, to a girl fight, and even a pillow fight. Proper fistfights aren’t excluded either, so it’s pretty much everything in one pack!
To make this work, it’s key to understand that this Sims 4 fighting mod isn’t actually one single mod, but a group of mods instead. They’re all made by the same creator/s and come from the same place. You can simply get the one that includes fighting and leave the rest. Or, you can install all of them and have a complete experience. The choice is yours!
Fights in The Sims 2 and The Sims Stories are a little more graphic and violent. Sims will pop up occasionally through the cloud of smoke, and will use a small variety of professional and comical fighting techniques. A Sim who is a child or older can start and watch fights. Sims with a higher body skill are more likely to win fights.
If you’re tired of your Sims disappearing behind clouds whenever they quarrel, then this mod is for you. It adds three new animations for three separate fighting moves. Watching your Sims actually perform these interactions is honestly amazing and we highly recommend it!
In The Sims 3, Sims can initiate a fight if they're very angry at each other. A Sim with the mean spirited trait has the "Beat Up" interaction, while a Sim with the proper trait has the "Give (Sim name) What For" interaction, on which the Sim will harass the other Sim before fighting.[TS3:SN] Sims with the proper trait cannot properly initiate fights, or attempt to defend against burglars even if they have the brave trait. Sims with the good trait cannot initiate fights at all, but they can still get involved in them, as well as win.
In The Sims 3: Late Night, Sims can brawl in addition to fight in a bar, club, or lounge (except future lounge)[TS3:ITF]. Brawling has a completely different system from fighting. A Sim can initiate a brawl with another, and more Sims can join (Sims may only autonomously join a brawl in a bar lot assignment). A brawl may last for 15–25 minutes, and additional 7–10 minutes per Sim involved. During a brawl, various debris will fall out of the fight cloud in a comical way.
When fighting occurs a cartoon-styled cloud of smoke will appear and obscure most of the fighting. Sims with higher body[TS][TS, athletic[TS or fitness[TS skill are more likely to win the fight. A police officer and a burglar will fight if the police are summoned during a burglary.[TS[TS
