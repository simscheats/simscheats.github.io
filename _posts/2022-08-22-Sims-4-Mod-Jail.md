## Sims 4 mod jail is a tool that allows players to jail other players for playing modded games.

Since the dawn of time, Sims has meddled in the concepts of police and prisons one way or another. In the past games, we had different systems and it’s hard to argue which version was the best. However, we can all agree that the prison in the TS4 police station isn’t exactly what we want, right? And instead, what we need is a proper jail that resembles real-world examples – tiny, cold, and inescapable cells. Well, meet this Sims 4 jail mod!

Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever.

Updated on October 31st, 2020 by Anastasia Maillot: The modding and custom content community for The Sims 4 is one of the most active ones in the world, with super dedicated creators. With the recent Journey To Batuu game pack and Eco Lifestyle expansion in 2020 having been a major disappointment for many simmers, mods are the go-to way to make the game actually bearable to play.
If you like to change things a bit have a new prison outfit in The Sims 4, then we recommend this one. It swaps the mundane orange suits with the recognizable black-and-white strip suits. This can be a very interesting addition to the game, especially if you have a prison station with a similar tone. We have found that it works great with the Sims 4 jail mod set we showcased above!

## Jailing players can prevent them from interacting with the game world, making it difficult for them to gain progress.

Once the orange bar is full, you can finish off the arrest and book them into the little jail attached to the station. Again though, try to only do the objectives listed; any additional action is a waste of your time and won't help your job performance.
Your Sim’s criminal life is not very lucrative at the beginning. They’ll need to complete all sorts of tasks and assignments (like being mean to other Sims, pickpocketing, trolling the forums and so on) to build their skills and climb the criminal ladder. Playful is the most important mood to have at this stage.
To make the game more family-friendly, certain aspects of the game were made more discreet. Any seasoned or older player knows exactly what's going on, but the younger demographic might not. And appealing to the latter required some censorship in more ways than one.
Oh, how we’ve all wished our destructive spells were, well, more destructive. Now they can be. Incinerate your enemies with Inferniate, freeze their hearts solid with Chillo, and melt their brains with ZipZap. Whoever taught you magic never thought you’d use it to steal lives.
After the arrest, you'll be sent back to the police station. Your job may not be done as you'll still need to interrogate the suspect. With a high enough Charisma Skill and enough evidence, you can convince them to confess. Either interact with the suspect or an interrogation table choose the appropriate command to start the interrogation. There you can play good cop or bad cop and confront them with the evidence, thus filling the orange bar at the top-center of the screen.
Note that on early levels of this profession, your objectives will not ask you to finish solving the case. This is due to your level: lowest-level rookie cops are there to assist, not take over investigations. As such, trying to "cheat the system" by catching crooks before the objectives list wants you to won't help your job progress. You still can do it if you want, but it won't help lead to promotions.
Once the objectives list allow you to and you have enough clues to solve the case, you can interact with the crime map to put out an all-points bulletin on the suspect. This will teleport you to a random lot where your suspect is guaranteed to be. Review your clues to deduce who the suspect is, then slap your handcuffs on him with a social interaction. If you deduce wrongly, you'll take a serious hit to your job performance and risk being demoted or fired.
Are the peaceful neighborhoods of Willow Creek driving players nuts? Would one day of sheer chaos be enough to bring balance back to the disgustingly happy-go-lucky life that every townie seems to live? Thankfully, there's a mod that fixes this with one go, to a point where no day is without its own unique excitement.
