## Sims 4 mod tool provides a way to make custom content for the game.

About Mods and Custom ContentMods and Custom Content are wildly popular among Sims 4 players, but if you're new to the franchise you may be unaware what treasures await those who ravenously scour the web for the latest downloads. There is far more free content available to download than is included in the base game and all game/stuff packs combined. In this guide, I'll teach you how to install CC and mods, explain what they are and offer some direction on where to go from here by providing links to sites where you can binge-download CC for your game.

If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)
Tumblr - this link leads to content tagged as sims-4-custom-content on tumblr, where many CC makers have an outlet to share their art. This can help you find creators you want to follow. It can be a good place to browse for new content visually, though be careful because you'll need to visit some download sites that can have confusing links. Watch out for ads that say 'download', and look for buttons like 'Skip ad' so that you can get past a full-screen ad that looks like a download page!
Make sure you have script mods enabled in your Sims 4 game options menu. Also make sure to unzip the file manually without the use of another tool, do this by opening the tool folder and dragging it to your mods folder. This will likely be in the location:
The Windows and macOS versions of The Sims 4 have extensive mod support, as per tradition in the main The Sims series. There are two types of mods: script mods and custom content. Script mods are written in Python, typically modifying or adding gameplay mechanics. There is also a large variety of custom content available, such as custom hairstyles, clothing, skin tones and furniture. The game was upgraded from Python 3.3.5 to 3.7.0 in a 2018 patch, which broke compatibility with existing script mods. All incompatible script mods have to be updated for the patch.

The Sims 4 Tool Mod is an acronym for 'Takes Objects Off Lot'. This Sims 4 mod essentially allows you to have more real estate space and place objects in the surrounding areas of your lot, past the pre-set grid. This is a handy mod to have installed if you wish to add or remove scenery that doesn’t mesh well with your builds. To learn how to download it for your game, read on.
The following are sites that are well-known for hosting CC and Mods. I want to say that I'm not responsible for anything you see or that happens as a result of using these sites. I'm putting those we're all most familiar with up top, as they're in general the best places to go to download things for Sims. Many creators have their own blogs, and they're worth following if you like their work. The two big sites up front here host many items though, and should be visited by anyone interested in expanding their game. You can then explore people's tumblr/wordpress blogs and find creators whose work you enjoy, follow them, and enjoy a better Sims game. Some CC creators specialize in hair, others clothing and some make a mix of everything.
Disabling Seasions But Keeping its Stuff - Want to disable weather or make plants in season year-round? You can do so with my new Seasons Tuner ModImproving Sims 4: The past month, I've spent every day tinkering The Sims 4, making quality of life improvements, gameplay changes, and new difficulty settings for the game. If you'd like to learn more about my project, visit the post on Patreon where you can download it now.
The Sims 4 features a revamped, room-based Build mode. Entire buildings and rooms can be moved across a lot, including all objects, floor and wall coverings, doors and windows. There is also a search function to search for Build mode objects. There are pre-made rooms that can be placed instantly. Wall heights can be adjusted. Players can also place down fully furnished rooms in a variety of styles. Swimming pools and ponds can be constructed with their respective tools.

## The sims 4 mod tool is easy to use and provides a lot of options for users.

Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
modthesims.info - Definitely my go-to, though I don't use CC heavily. Everything on MTS is totally free, and it's exceptionally well-organized. This makes for an easy browsing experience. They feature so much content that they are almost all you need in order to really beef up your game with CC. Of course, modthesims also has plenty of mods, and many of the best mod makers in The Sims community are members there.
To download the Sims 4 TOOL mod by TwistedMexi, you'll first need to find the mod page on her Patreon. Normally, you have to be a paying patron on Patreon to access creator posts, but TwistedMexi has listed this mod for public use, so you don't need to pay anything here. Follow these steps to download the mod:
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
Using the TOOL mod is quite easy. Enter Build/Buy mode (you can also use the mod in Live mode, but it sometimes acts up when doing this) in Sims 4 and hit Shift+T to activate the TOOL mode. Once the menu has been activated, choose how you want to move the lot item. Adjust as necessary and place like normal.
Backing up Saved Games, Mods, and CCYou can backup your Mods and CC just as you can Save files, and it's smart to do this in case of disaster. Copy them to another drive or a USB stick and they're safe from hard drive failure. Head to your Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4 folder. Right click each of those three important folders - Saves, Tray, and Mods. Copy them then paste in a new location, where you know to find them. Should you have to reinstall the game or wipe everything, you've got a copy of your Sims families, and kept your collection of CC and Mods. These are precious because it takes time to build up a collection, and losing dozens of downloads can be a major nuisance.
The Sims Resource - TSR is also a high quality site for downloading CC, and like MTS features content for Sims 3 as well. If you get addicted to CC you may even want to join as a VIP, which makes mass-downloading items much easier and removes ads from the site.
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.
