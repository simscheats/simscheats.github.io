The reason why the idea of custom worlds rivals even the best mod or CC pack is that it opens new opportunities in Sims 4. Just imagine an empty world where you can start everything from scratch! Or even better, imagine a world that’s already built especially for you, where everything is pretty and organized, and simply feels right. If that sounds tempting, then you, my friend, must take this journey with us and find the best custom worlds mod for The Sims 4!
In The Sims 4, we have the total freedom to be ourselves. But what if we can’t truly be ourselves in one of the base-game worlds? What if our soul belongs somewhere else? Well, if that’s the case with you, then you aren’t completely out of luck! It’s totally possible to access custom worlds and load them like any other mod in The Sims 4.
For those familiar with The Sims 4, a custom world mod is essentially a shared save game. Everything a player creates in The Sims 4 can be found in their save file and can be accessed by any other player in the game. With the right know-how, a player in TS4 can completely destroy one of the game’s worlds and start again from scratch. Following this, we will discuss how to obtain a world devoid of inhabitants.
What is interesting here is that these are all fanmade worlds that many Sims 4 players create. And because of that, you can find so many unique worlds, some of which you’ve never even dreamed of! The internet is full of such creations and you can find the ideal one for yourself. And if you want to check our favorite selection of Sims 4 custom worlds, check the mods in the list below!

## Choose a sims 4 mod world to compete in

Updated May 30, 2022 by Ritwik Mitra: There aren't many life simulator games that are as fun as The Sims. The franchise has become a major phenomenon from the very first entry, and even the rocky start of The Sims 4 didn't stop players from enjoying this title after it was bombarded with its fair share of content updates and expansion packs. The modding community for this game is as strong as ever, and here are some great fan-made content for people who want The Sims 4 to be pretty realistic.
Players are adding new careers to ModTheSims every week, so if you’re ever looking for inspiration on which direction to steer your Sim in, give it a browse. The imagination behind them is impressive, and most of them give you a fully-fleshed out path to follow.
TwistedMexi has been working hard on their upcoming Create A World mod that has well and truly captured the communities’ attention! While the mod itself is still in the Alpha stage, TwistedMexi has released a new overview video showcasing the mod in more detail as well as a work in progress world from one of the Alpha Testing members.

Even eight years in, new mods still pop up all the time on ModTheSims (opens in new tab)—which has long been the biggest platform for creators. You'll find everything from minor changes to total reworks. Some well-known modders, including LittleMsSam (opens in new tab) and KawaiiStacie (opens in new tab), have even become so big they have their own websites for their collections of creations.
The necessary activities for career progression are naturally related to the career—programming, cooking, exercising—and sometimes Sims will receive fieldwork. An athlete might have to go to the gym and show off her muscles, while a Sim who works in business might have to offer career advice to those running retail venues.
