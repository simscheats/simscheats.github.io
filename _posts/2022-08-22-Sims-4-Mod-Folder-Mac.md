## How to set up a sims 4 mod folder on a mac.

or instead you can copy your mods folder to your desk top to make a copy and then delete the mods folder that is in your Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4. Do not delete the copy you put on your desktop or you will lose all of your mods and custom content.

The Mods FolderNext, find or create the Mods folder. It should already be there, but if it's not you can right click in the white area within The Sims 4 folder and create a folder, being sure to name it Mods. The game automatically recognizes and attempts to utilize anything in this folder. So, once we download CC, we'll copy the files to that folder. Tip: You can have other folders inside the Mods folder, so if you'd like to separate out your CC and Mods in to separate folders, or even categorize them by object/clothing type, you can do so! Additionally, Forum member RandyH notes that it's possible to rename mods so long as you keep the .package at the end of the file name. This can make your organization even simpler, and possibly help you track things down easier. All of this is actually a good idea should you run into a mod or piece of CC that gives you trouble, so that it's easier to find and remove.
i just bought a new mac, the latest version. I had all my saves and mods from over 1 year of playing so i would like to put it in my new mac, i already installed the sims 4 from origin but i cannot find the electronic arts or sims 4 folder‚Ä¶ the game works; but there are no folders on the mac so i dont know how to put my saved games and mods!!!!

I have a Mac and to save space on it I have my sims installed on an external drive (so i can run other programs faster while in class as well). Im having problems installing mods as i can not find the folder for mods. how do i proceed? how can I install mods on my sims if it's installed on an external drive.
Custom content and general mods: These files end in .package. Open the Mod folder the game has created (Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods) and copy all the mod files into the folder. You can create additional subfolders to organize your growing mod collection better.

So.. I know how to download cc and all, but I just got a new laptop and I downloaded the Sims. Sadly, I can't fimd the Mods folder anywhere. I don't even have the Electronic Arts folder in the Documents folder-thing. I don't know what went wrong but I would appreciate some help or advice. Thanks!
Go to your Sims 4 folder, right-click on the folder titled "Saves" and then copy it. Paste your Saves folder somewhere else on your computer, like your desktop. That way you'll have a "safe" version of your saved game in case anything goes wrong while testing.
Hello!
So I got everything right, but it seems like I am still having trouble with my mods. When I launch the game I get the message showing all of the stuff I have put into my mods folder. I also have made sure to click on the enable script. Yet I go to make a sims but can‚Äôt find any of the content anywhere! I am missing a step or is my game bugged? I don‚Äôt understand how it I get the message showing my mods but then when I go make a sims I can‚Äôt find any of the content.
I‚Äôm glad my guide could be of help. I‚Äôm unfamiliar with the mod you are talking about (but I have seen it around), but if you didn‚Äôt get it working I would have suggested checking to see if there were specific instructions on the mod page. Just a reminder that some mods do in fact stay IN a .zip file too. üôÇ Again, refer to each mod‚Äôs specific instructions for whether or not you do that.

## How to install sims 4 mods on a mac.

Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
no installation required, it's just moving files into a folder. but you first need to find a mod you like, then download it and move the extracted files (usually .package and .ts4script) to documents / electronic arts / the sims 4 / mods. then enable them in game options - other. when you restart the game they will be ready to use.
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in ‚Äú[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.‚Äù (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the ‚ÄúMods‚Äù folder doesn‚Äôt exist, you can make your own, as long as it‚Äôs in the same location.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
Next up, you‚Äôll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can‚Äôt tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include ‚ÄúMod The Sims‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Sims Resource‚Äù, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
Go to your Mods folder and right-click it. Again, copy it to your Desktop. Once you're sure you have a copy of your Mods folder on your Desktop, go ahead and delete the copy in your Sims 4 folder. Restart your game and play it for a few minutes. If your game runs without crashing or having errors, you know the issue is with one of your Mods. If it doesn't, you'll need to go out and repair your game (and the issue is something within your Sims 4 game itself).
btw, do you know of any mods tracker for ts4 mac? if not, do you have any advices or useful tips? i installed a whole bunch of mods at once and my game keeps crashing now x/ when i manage to get it loading my sims does not interact with each other when i click for them to interact like ask about day or share interest.
If anyone can help me‚Ä¶I just downloaded sims 4.i have downloaded a couple pieces of mods.i have a macbook air.and the mod is already unzipped.when I try to go in my mods folder it wont let me place anything in it and the resource.cfg file is all greyed out‚Ä¶what do I do???
