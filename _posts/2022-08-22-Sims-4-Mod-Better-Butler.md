Butlers’ existence can secure a household’s smooth performance as they form a crucial part of the internal sphere. Consequently, the Sims 4 butler mod has been instituted in the game to allow your characters with a couple of helping hands instead of doing it whole on their own.

The butler is more than just a super-maid. For a base fee of §20, plus §25 per hour, he replaces the gardener, repairman, maid, and nanny as well, so having him is very useful. In fact, when initially hired, the butler blatantly says that he's better than them and asks the player's permission to just fire them all and be done with it, so Sims won't have to worry about that.
Butlers return in The Sims 4: Vintage Glamour Stuff. They are hired through the phone under the "hire a service" option for a §175 payment along with a §12/hr maintenance cost weekly. Butlers are randomized NPCs with random appearances and traits; their traits dictate how well they will work as a butler.

## Better butlers changes the way the game handles household chores, making them more manageable and fair for both sims and butler sims.

Butlers’ presence can ensure a household’s smooth functioning as they form a vital part of the domestic sphere. Therefore, Sims 4 butler mod has been introduced in the game to provide your characters with a pair of helping hands instead of doing it all on their own. Read more to understand how it functions.
Although a small extension, the Butler Mod really ups the quality of the day-to-day gameplay. Having the perfect responses and interactions with your servants is an immersive characteristic that many find it almost mandatory for simming. We’re happy that such a tool exists, and we recommend you to give it a try!
When you’re bored of having just one butler in your Sims’ house and you want more, just hire extra butlers. From the Household Category, select ‘Phones’. From the appearing Pie Menu, hire up to 4 more butlers. However, keep in mind that you must have the household mod to do so.
You say your SIM doesn't have to interact with the butler, but you have to be able to FIND them!!! Mine have always been a pain. By the time I find them, I may as well have a different sim perform the task. Mine all laze about, standing around when stuff needs done. Even with neat, perfectionist traits.
The butler returns in The Sims 2: Apartment Life. Sims can hire a butler to do all those nasty chores they don't want to do themselves. That description alone makes him sound no more interesting than the maid, but the butler is so much more than that. First of all, he walks over at around 7am and stays until 8pm, even if there is nothing for him to do. This way, he'll immediately respond to any little dirty dish or moldy bathtub that pops up.
All Butler management is accomplished using the Butler menu when you click on your servant. Your Sims' Butler can do four different tasks automatically. Any of these tasks can be turned off by clicking the Butler and selecting the 'Responsibilities' tab. This may help them to better prioritize the things you want them to do. For example if having the Butler do child care is not a priority because you want your Sim to do it, turn it off.
At times my butler appears wearing his normal everyday wear (jeans and T-shirt luckily from when he is the cities busker when I am rotated away from this particular family) but usually after my sims have traveled away from the lot and back again this sorts itself out. Maybe try deleting the localthumbcache.package file from your TheSims 4 folder before repairing your game as it is quicker and uses no internet connection.Basically the butler is somewhat glitched but I can appreciate just how annoying a llama costume would be.
That's not happening in my game. I play rotationally and even after being rotated away from the family with the butler for over 5 sim weeks the same butler is still there. I wonder what we are doing differently to have such different results? Do you use mods?
