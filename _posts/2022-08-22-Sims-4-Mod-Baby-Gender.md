## How to change the gender of a sim in the sims 4.

The latest Sims 4 Game Patch has given The Sims 4 a complete overhaul in Create-a-Sim, giving players the option to customize their gender, select advanced options for pregnancy, and utilize any of the available female and male assets for either gender.

If the optional step above was not used, open the Sim Browser, find the changed Sim, and open that Sim in the Plugin View. In "Overview", set the "Treat as:" radio button to Male or Female, to reflect the changes made to the Sim's character file. Commit, then Save. Note: Do not use the Sim Browser's "Overview" to change the Sim's first name. Use one of the methods outlined in Game guide:Changing names.
By default, Female and Male Sims in the game will continue to retain the default “Feminine” and “Masculine” customization options. This includes all NPCs, Townies, and Sims created in CAS. These Sims will not randomize with any of their default physiques, clothing preferences, pregnancy and toilet use options changed, unless you change them yourself.
There’s no denying it – we’ve always needed a gender preference mod for The Sims 4! And ever since the game came out, it’s has been kind of odd not having this tool. Like real people, our Sims are unique too and should have different preferences than other Sims. And as simmers, we need to have complete control over their preference!
This customisation allows the player to choose whether a Sim can 'Become Pregnant', 'Get others pregnant', or 'Neither'. By default, female Sims can 'Become Pregnant' and male Sims can 'Get others pregnant', but now you can choose how your characters operate under the hood.

We mentioned that the Sims 4 gender preference mod is a very simple extension. Basically, it adds a new interaction option in your game called “Set Gender Preference”. And the way to find this interaction is this Click on your Sim Select More Choices Choose Set Gender Preference.
There are two ways you can change (or at least influence) the gender of a baby-to-be in The Sims 4. We’ll go over the cheating method first. Before you start, though, remember that activating cheats on Sims 4 on console means you can’t unlock any trophies or achievements. If they’re important to you, then don’t do this!
Like choosing a baby’s gender, there are two ways to influence if your pregnant Sim will have twins in The Sims 4. The first and most efficient way is to use cheats. For this cheat code, you’ll need to get your Sim’s ID. You can do this by typing sims.get_sim_id_by_name (enter Sim's name here). When you enter this, you’ll get a long string of numbers that you’ll need to write down.
The Sims 4 gender preference mod is an awesome tool that helps you control the sexual relationships of your Sims. The best part about it is that you can choose the percentages of different preferences. For example, if you’d like to see more homosexual couples than heterosexual ones, you simply need to select that option!

## How to change the gender of a sim in the sims 4 without using mod tools.

With the new advanced gender customization options in place, you can now choose whether or not and how your Sims conceive. Previously, without the use of 3rd party mods, Female Sims were the only human Sim allowed to become pregnant, and Male Sims are the only human Sim allow. Now, everything has changed and no restrictions are in place.
With the restrictions removed, the new pregnancy options allow you to choose which Sims can conceive, regardless of gender. Not only can you remove fertility from a Sim all together, female Sims can now impregnate male Sims, and same-sex couples can naturally conceive.
Clothing in The Sims 4 Base Game and previous packs have been converted to Unisex clothing. The gender restriction for “Mascluline” and “Feminine” clothing has been lifted on about 700 pieces of Clothing, Hairstyles, Accessories, Makeup, and Shoes, so now Sims of any gender can wear any of the clothing they choose. Unisex Clothing is available to all Sims Child through Elder and work independent of any advanced gender customization options.
However, one of the newest features of this mod allows you to set the gender preferences based on percentage and not category. This way, you won’t remove any other preferences from your Sim. For example, you can set it in a way so your Sim will have 40% preferences towards men and 60% preferences towards women.
Pregnancy Options – This allows you to choose whether or not your Sims will impregnate other Sims, become pregnant by other Sims, or none of the above, regardless of gender. With these options you can now allow same-sex couples and Male Sims to naturally conceive in the game without the need for an Alien invasion or 3rd party mod.
Physical Frame – This allows you to choose a “Masculine” or “Feminine” physical frame for Sims regardless of their gender. Do note that even if you have a Male Sim with a feminine physique, you will not be able to add or customize breast size. That still relies on gender.
❗ To change the advanced options for already existing Sims, you will have to take them into Create-a-Sim and alter the advanced options. To do this, click on any mirror or dresser and select the “Change Sim” option. This will take you into full edit mode.
To change a baby’s gender, next type in “cas.fulleditmode”. This activates a tool that allows you to fully edit a sim. Note you can only do this after the baby’s been born; you’ll need to shift-click on the baby, which will then give you access to information in the same way the Create-a-Sim tool does. In there, you can toggle gender to your desired choice.
