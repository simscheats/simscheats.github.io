In the end, it doesn’t really matter which method you’re using, the Mod Checker or the Tray Importer. Both programs can help you find and remove bad CC in Sims 4, so it’s up to you to choose which one you’re going to use. I’d say that the Mod Checker offers a quicker process, but the Tray Importer has more options overall. So, make your decision based on that.
The Sims 4 Mod Conflict Detector is a powerful tool based on GUI which is used for detection & solving the mod conflicts found in this game. This program allows the gamers to remove the trouble-making Sims 4 mods, technically failing mods, empty mods, and so on.
When learning how to find bad CC in Sims 4, the Tray Importer is one of the best things you’ll stumble across. I’m especially happy to introduce it to you if you’ve never used it. And I can definitely say that this program has the potential to be your one-in-all mod and CC management program for Sims 4.
The Mod Checker is software that scans your entire Mods folder and discovers the broken CC files automatically. It will list all of your CC and mods from your Mods folder, and it will show which of your downloads are outdated or broken. You can then go to those folders and manually delete them.

These websites have a dedicated table that contains a list of all the available mods for the game, along with their status to help you know whether they’re working anymore or not. This allows you to remove the mods that are about to expire beforehand to prevent glitches.
There are several web-based applications known as mod trackers that keep you updated with all the new and expired mods of the game. All you need to do is run a quick Google search and you’ll find numerous mod trackers available for absolutely free of cost.
However, the Tray Importer also has the option to scan your Mods folder and identify your bad CC. When it does find a broken file, you can choose whether to find that exact Mod/CC on google or remove it directly. This way, you can find a newer version of the bad CC and simply replace it instead of removing it right away. And this is especially great if you don’t want to change your gameplay just because a mod file has suddenly broken.
The Mod Checker runs all processes automatically and without any problem. You simply need to select the folder you want to scan, and that’s it. The program is updated regularly. And in my personal experience, it recognizes all custom content and mods you may have found on the internet.

## Use the mod manager to fix broken cc sims 4 mods.

Remember that using the broken mods or outdated form of tuning mods might cause the game to work in an unpredictable manner. Further, it can lead to issues such as game corruption. So, you can opt for the Sims 4 bad cc finder to note if there is a broken or outdated mod in your game.
Now, you can always open up your Mods folder and delete your CC manually. If your game isn’t overloaded with custom content, removing the bad files will be pretty easy. However, if you generally use a lot of Sims 4 CC, you’ll probably need software to help you with this.
Go to your “Mods” folder and open it. Here you can see all of your installed mods and CC. Delete the first folder, then jump into the game to check whether the issue is still there. If it’s not – congratulations, you’ve deleted the broken CC file. But if the problem is still there – you’ll need to repeat the process over and over again.
Of course, this is the hardest and the most troublesome way of doing this for two main reasons. First, it takes a lot of time. And second, you might end up deleting all the mods and CC that you love. And I do NOT recommend this way if you’re a total beginner in Sims 4!
Something that many simmers struggle with is actually finding the one custom content file that’s causing all the glitches. And sometimes, you can spend an entire day deleting stuff that you didn’t need to, just to find the one little piece that’s the root of all problems. But I want to show you a new, modern, and better way to find broken CC in Sims 4 and remove it.
Dealing with broken CC in Sims 4 is never too easy. The whole process can be problematic, especially for new players. The truth is – there’s nothing we can do to stop certain files from going bad in Sims 4. In fact, all we can do is identify these files once they’re broken, remove them, and add them again if needed. So, in this post, I’ll go over how to find bad CC in Sims 4 and remove it.
If your game happens to freeze at a certain point into the game, you can use the Sims 4 cc checker to detect what’s wrong with the custom content that you have added to the game. Also, if you are wondering how to find bad cc, you can use several tools available online for the same. A bad or corrupted cc can harm the game.
Logging into The Sims 4 with the wish to have an awesome time but instead finding that some of your CC is causing glitches and errors is one of the worst experiences in a simmer’s life. It’s not only that we have to say goodbye to a certain CC piece. Instead, it’s all the trouble we have to go through in order to remove it. So, in this post, I’ll want to show you how to find broken CC in Sims 4 and remove it quickly, safely, and in the easiest way possible!
