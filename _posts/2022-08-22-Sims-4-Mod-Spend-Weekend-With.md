## Players spend a weekend playing the newest sims 4 mod and exploring the game's new features.

With this mod installed, you'll notice that 'idle chat' has been totally removed, with Sims being forced to have meaningful interactions instead of filler at every opportunity. Using their traits and moods and other pointers, the game will find things for Sims to talk about whenever they interact.

Truly an exciting and fun gameplay upgrade is the introduction of new phone features in the game. The social media function of smartphones are already a good thing, but what makes this mod even much better is the useful phone apps that help build up different types of skill for your Sims. Examples of these apps are the Fishing Simulator, Mall Tycoon, My First Language, Let’s Draw, Love Tester, and Homework Helper.
If you’re a gameplay enthusiast or storyteller who loves creating lots of drama with your Sims, you should check out the WooHoo Wellness and Pregnancy Overhaul mod by Lumpinou!

The mod is made up of multiple modules you can install separately so it’s fully customisable to suit your own preferences. Install features you want and discard the ones you don’t; it’s up to you!
Here's another fantastic mod that adds extra layers to the overall gameplay experience of The Sims 4. Developed by a creator named Roburky, Meaningful Stories redesigns the mood and emotions system of The Sims 4 to make your Sims' lives feel more important and interesting.
