## S4 mods manager is broken and cc can't be loaded.

Go to your “Mods” folder and open it. Here you can see all of your installed mods and CC. Delete the first folder, then jump into the game to check whether the issue is still there. If it’s not – congratulations, you’ve deleted the broken CC file. But if the problem is still there – you’ll need to repeat the process over and over again.

Keep in mind that you don’t have to delete all mods from beginning to end if you know exactly which CC file causes the problem. For example, if you see that a skin overlay CC is causing glitches in the CAS menu, you won’t have to delete MC Command Center. Instead, go over the skin CC you’ve downloaded only.
This is really common for mods, as they can become outdated with most recent game patches. If the game works when the Mods folder is removed, then one or more of the mods and/or custom content have become outdated and will need to be removed or replaced. EA/Maxis isn’t responsible for broken mods/cc. It is up to the individual creators to fix their own mods.
Launch the game. If the error is gone, then the problematic mod is in the other half folder. If the error is present, then the problematic mod is somewhere in the set you moved back into the Mods folder. Whichever set of mods has the bad mod, you can just repeat the process again: subdivide the remaining mods into two halves and try each one in turn.
If your mods are not functioning properly in Sims 4, there are some free tools created by the modding community that will help you find and delete the files. The process can be tedious, but the best way is using Sims 4 Studio (a free tool for making custom content) and Sims 4 Tray Importer.

The Mod Checker is software that scans your entire Mods folder and discovers the broken CC files automatically. It will list all of your CC and mods from your Mods folder, and it will show which of your downloads are outdated or broken. You can then go to those folders and manually delete them.
Method 1: After you have closed the game client and moved the Mods folder to your desktop, begin moving the files back to the Mods folder in your game directory one at a time. You should be moving game-play mods out of your Mods folder, not CAS or Build/Buy items.
Remember that using the broken mods or outdated form of tuning mods might cause the game to work in an unpredictable manner. Further, it can lead to issues such as game corruption. So, you can opt for the Sims 4 bad cc finder to note if there is a broken or outdated mod in your game.
