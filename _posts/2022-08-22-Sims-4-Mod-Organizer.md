## Sims 4 mod organizer is a tool that lets you manage and organize your mods.

If you ask why, then you’re on the right track to make your life a lot easier. You see, the Mod Manager is a quality of life, fully developed software that helps you organize all The Sims 4 files. If you’ve ever found yourself in the mess of all the additional mods and CC you download for the game, then this is your ticket out of that hell!

The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
Is there a mod organizer out there for sims 4 that makes it easier and faster to download cc/mods? I'm specifically thinking about Nexus Mod Manager for Skyrim/Fallout and how easy it is to manage and download with the click of a button, instead if doing it all manually like with sims 4. Is there something like that for origin games/sims 4?
(I know this belongs in Mods and CC discussion but I might have to wait 2 weeks for an answer there, vs a matter of minutes here lol)
Thanks!
Anyone who uses Mods or Custom Content in The Sims 4, or even from any of previous The Sims games, will know that your Mods folder can sometimes feel a little overwhelming. However, GameTimeDev has created a program to help players keep their Mods folder organized.
This program is designed to help you bring order to your Sims 4 mod folder. It tries to extract thumbnails from the files or if that doesn't work, it searches for a thumbnail online. This is not always perfect, but helps to see what is included in a particular mod.

The Mod & Custom Content Manager is described as a file explore with additional features which allows you to browse your files for The Sims 4 easily. You are able to delete and move files but also disable and enables files both on their own, in multiples or even whole folders. View files alongside thumbnails, which will help you distinguish content that is for Build Buy Mode or Create A Sim.
With the previous versions of Sims 4 Mod Organizer or Manager, the installation of package mods first required you to extract “Package” files from somewhere & add them alongside the mod organizer. However, in the latest version of the TS4MM or The Sims 4 Mod Manager, this particular step has been removed. If the mods or package mods downloaded by you are contained inside the “.rar”, “.zip”, or “.7z” archive, one can simply drag the same into the manager and add the same with a button.
So, if your Sims 4 game is facing issues with these errors, the key is to opt for the Sims 4 cc organizer. With the help of this mod organizer, you can sort all your existing mods. In simple terms, it isn’t just a mod organizer, rather, it helps with proper installation, removal, fixing, as well as organizing of the Sims 4 mods.
And if you click on the furthermost tool in the same corner, the one labeled Open The Sims 4 “Mods” folder, you will be directed to the destination of your installed mod. Notice that if a mod isn’t checked/selected in the main list on the Mod Manger, then it won’t be shown in the folder either.

## If you're new to mods, mod organizer is a great way to start.

You’ve got everything in a nice long list, right? But now you need to organize it! To do this, click on the first tool icon at the bottom right corner, called Add a new category/Folder. Then you will be asked to name the new folder, so go ahead and do that.
When you are done creating the category, you will quickly notice that it doesn’t appear on the main page. That is because there’s nothing in it yet! But, if you click on the “+” and add a mod or two, you will be asked if you want to store them in your newly created folder or not. If you choose to do so, the mods will be listed in that category on the main page.
We have found that the best way to tidy up our library is by naming the categories by a file type. For example, we have a “Hair” category where all our hair mods and CC are stored, then “Clothes” one, then “Accessories”, “Traits”, “Build” etc. But you’re free to find your own ways and organize your files however you want. The point is to make it all easy to navigate through so you can save more time for actually playing the game!
We’re talking about putting everything in the right place, renamed and clear folders, the ability to turn on and off certain mods whenever you want, to put every CC you’ve ever gotten in a correct library… It is truly an invaluable tool and a real time saver!
To my knowledge, no. I download stuff, highlight all the zip files in My Downloads, right click and "Unzip to here". After that, I highlight the files and copy and paste them into the Test sub-folder that's in my mods folder. Once I know nothing is breaking my game (or ugly), then the items are thrown into category folders (clothing, makeup, build, furniture, scripts, etc) Having sub-folders keeps everything organized. If something does break the game after an update, it's usually a script so they are easy to find since I group those together.
The 'Problems' tab on the left-hand side is a great tool for finding any CC files that have been corrupted or are outdated. Before now, to find a broken CC file you would have to uninstall all custom content and mods and add each one back into the game until the broken one could be located. Now, with the Mod Manager, you have a chance of locating them with much more ease.
Since I also have to concentrate on my studies, I unfortunately can't put as much time into the project. However, I will continue programming when I have time. If you have ideas how to improve the tool, please write me and I will try to implement it. But for now I will concentrate on fixing bugs.
Problems – here you will find any files that may be weird or duplicated. Weird files may not actually be broken files but may not be loading correctly. However, you can send any peculiar acting files to GameTimeDev for further investigation. As for duplicated files, this is a work in progress feature at the moment but will show any files that you may have multiples of.
