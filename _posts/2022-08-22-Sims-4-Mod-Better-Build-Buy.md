## Sims 4 mod that allows players to buy and build their own buildings.

The Sims 4 apartments mod is a complete extension that’s here to help you with everything around apartments in the game. It lets you search and find apartments on the City Living map and allows your Sims to get situated there. But it also provides ways for you to build apartments in the game, which you can use later on. All in all, it’s the ultimate mod to use if you’re even a bit interested in living in an apartment in the Sims 4.

First of all, the Sims 4 apartments mod is actually a group of individual mods who were developed by the same person and work incredibly together. The whole point here is to provide all the necessary tools for both buildings and living in an apartment in Sims 4.
The Sims 4 apartments mod isn’t only good for building apartments. It comes with a pack of mods that help you control your apartment and set the rules for everyone else. As a landlord, you can set payment methods and rental fee rules, which is great. And with the T.O.O.L. mod, you can edit the apartment to be exactly how you want it to be. Overall, the apartment mod offers a neat experience and we totally recommend it!
Better Build/Buy might be one of the slightly more involved mods to set up, but it’s worth the few extra steps. It makes building a lot easier, giving you access to hidden Sims 4 objects you’d normally have to work harder for or use a cheat to get. It comes loaded with other features as well, from expanding your build catalog from two rows to five, clone objects without restrictions, and find items easier thanks to their technical labels.
Sims 4 doesn’t just have a host of expansion, game and stuff packs all designed to expand your gameplay and give you access to new experiences for your Sims. It also has a thriving modding community that offers players new content, cheats and shortcuts, and a whole bunch of experiences and playable encounters that Maxis hasn’t officially made accessible.

Sims 4 has been a hit for years, particularly on PC, but it’s currently a free game on PS4 for PlayStation Plus subscribers. While you’ll spend a lot of time micro-managing your sims, you might want to make big changes to their lives. If you’re looking to permanently change your sims’ surrounding, here’s everything you need to know about how to buy a house in Sims 4 on PS4 and Xbox One.
With the option to rotate, size up, size down, elevate and move objects around on and off of your current lot, this mod is an absolute dream for builders who are looking for that extra bit of control to truly bring their vision or a story to life. You can even replace apartment windows with completely new ones!
City Living introduced the concept of apartments to The Sims 4. And even though the expansion had other cool features, players mostly liked the ability for their Sims to live in buildings, rather than houses. But like many other Sims 4 features, apartments weren’t too complex as well. For example, we couldn’t build or even edit our City Living apartment until mods were published months later. And that’s where the Sims 4 apartments mod came into play!
Then, choose the family of sims you want to move and select the house you want to buy for them. Once you’re sure you’ve found their dream house, select confirm in the bottom right of the screen, the the tick on the menu in the middle of the screen, and then ‘play’ to actually jump into the game and see your sims in their new home.

## Modder creates sims 4 mod that allows players to buy and build their own buildings.

Mods can add a lot of value to players who are looking for new experiences in The Sims 4, or when they're a bit bored between new Expansion Packs. Many modders have their own sites and do not host their files elsewhere, so mods for this game can be a bit scattered. For this reason I decided to curate a list of good-quality mods that are up-to-date at time of writing, and revisit this at times to remove mods that fall out of date and add new finds.
If you’re looking to add a more personal touch to your Sims’ homes, this is the mod for you. While photos taken by your Sims can be hung around your home with frames already – Ravasheen’s mod spawns frameless versions of already existing photos (either from your inventory, or those that are in-world).
Each new pack release in the game sees the army of modders on Tumblr, Patreon, and sites like ModTheSims jumping in to improve features or expand upon them. After trawling the internet, we’ve put together a list of our personal best mods for The Sims 4.
The mod that we’re showcasing here was shared with us by Gamer Gatino who originally published the mod at sims4studio. And by now, most people in the Sims 4 community have either heard of the mod or even tried it for themselves. In our opinion, everyone should at least give it a shot since it’s the best mod in its category. It provides a wholesome apartment experience for the game, so why not download it?
Modder Zero has a huge archive of free gameplay mods that are incredibly useful for expanding play in The Sims 4. Whether that’s improving upon Spellcasters, Ghosts, and Vampires, expanding Aliens into Time Lords from Doctor Who, or tweaking autonomy actions for your Sims, there’s a whole lot to choose from.
by Various Modders
ModTheSims has a huge traits area where you can download individual traits for your Sims, some of which are very highly specific. Like, want to make your Sim have Narcolepsy or Bipolar I? You can do that! I'm not kidding when I say the Sims modding community has covered a lot of mental illnesses, but there are also some more lighthearted things like being good at baking or inept at cooking.
This mod allows your Sim to create delicious meals such as tandoori chicken, peach pie, and apple salad just to name a few. When you install this mod, be sure to check out the #Custom food tag on modthesins.info to get the latest and greatest of custom foods!
While not technically a mod per see, this expands upon Simp4Sims’ previous GraphicsRules, giving you the chance to either download certain 3 presets, each with their own strength to tweak the game’s visuals, or go into more detail and customize them as you need.
