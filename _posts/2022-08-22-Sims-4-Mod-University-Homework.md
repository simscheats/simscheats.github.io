## Understanding how mods work in sims 4.

If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)

There are more awesome features in this mod, but I’d like you to explore them for yourself. In a nutshell, the Go to School mod is the complete school experience for Sims 4. It introduces everything you’d ever need in a school mod, so I recommend you try it.
The biggest game-changer that this mod introduces is the fact that you’ll actually play with your Sims while they’re at school. You can watch them and control them as you would while they’re at home. Not to mention that actually going to school is a realistic feature that most simmers wanted for the game since day 1.
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.
You should use the Sims 4 Go to School mod as the best school tool for the game. The first thing you need to do is to download and install the actual mod. Second, you’ll need to place one of the two new avenues on a lot. And third, you’ll need to send your Sims to attend school!

As the Education System Bundle coincides with the Playable School Events mod that was previously mentioned, this one can be played completely on its own! In reality, there are three different mods combined into one to give your parent Sims some more flexibility on what they want to do with their offspring!
The Sims 4 Go to School Mod Pack allows us to follow our child and teen Sims to where they usually disappear to Monday through Friday from 8 AM - 3 PM. This mod allows the user to go to school and have a list of tasks for the Sim to do throughout their school day.
The Simston Private School mod is a little throwback to the Sims 2 game, which allows you to invite the headmaster of the local private school to a dinner party for a hefty 500 Simoleons. Once you complete the several tasks associated with the event (and after succeeding only) you can pay the additional 1,000 Simoleons to enroll your child/teen Sim into SimCity Academy!
Zero’s Sims 4 Mods created the ‘University Costs More’ mod which changes the costing structure of electives and main classes. Now, both electives and main classes are more expensive, which is more realistic. You can also tune the mod to how much you’d like your Sims to pay.

## Creating your first mod.

If you have a liking for children, then you might also enjoy the process of making them. In such scenarios, a constant search for new features might make your head wobble. Do not stress yourself as the game has several sex mods and Nsfw Mods in it, and do not worry if you want to learn about them, as we have got you covered.
To get this University homework done you’ll want to click on the homework book and choose which class’ homework you actually want to work on and get started. You don’t have to do it all in one sitting so you can start and stop as many times as you want.
This guide is not for the casual university student. This guide will walk you through how to throw yourself completely into your education in order to achieve the best grades (and the best future) possible. Throw away your juice kegs and break out those textbooks because school is all you’re going to know for the next three terms.
This was created to address the issue of there just being not enough time for Teens. Between going to school and satisfying their needs, there’s very little time left for them to finish their homework, work on Skills, and complete Extra Credit projects.
The next trick is using the club! Make sure, if you go to the university, add everyone you see to your club. Focus on getting “Rally the Troops” perk. That will allow you to get back all your energy and other needs quickly whenever you want. There is no cooldown on this. It requires 500 points so it’s not bad at all. Just make sure the gathering is on at all times(which it should be since you most likely won’t be leaving the lot). The homework perk does not work for university.
In UBrite, you can brush up on your debating skills, while in Foxbury you have a chess table as well as robotics workstations at your disposal. If you live in a dorm where you can only have limited items, it's a good idea to take advantage of all these skill objects.
Not to mention, with no gyms around a short bike ride is sure to get your Sim's fitness skill up and keep them from gaining too much weight from all the instant noodles and pizza they'll likely consume. To get yourself a bike, you can buy one at your campus kiosk.
Hosting a successful keg party will even get you a special reward by the end of it, so if you're all about collecting the special items, this is a must activity. So, get your music and snacks on, and live the university experience to the fullest with a classic keg party.
