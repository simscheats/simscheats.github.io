## Create a career for your sim in a dj mod.

On both community and residential lots, other Sims can ask the DJ to change the type of music playing. Unlike The Sims, the DJ booth cannot play any radio stations. There are four options to choose from: "Slow", "Medium", "Fast", and "House Mix". A Sim who is a DJ can also be directly instructed by the player to change stations.

Your own sim can't actually play as a DJ as a career. You can direct your sim to play as the clubs DJ though as the NPC DJ will move away a little and just sort of stand there.
Your sim will earn some tips but the tips are bugged at the moment with the amount of tips you actually get deposited into your household funds not matching the notifications.
At level 8 your sims can begin creating Mix-O-Lot tapes. These can be used to earn an extra bit of income from your new found DJ mixing skills! Like with publishing books your sims can use their letterbox to send off their mix tapes to be licensed one at a time. To be allowed another license your sims will need to petition the studio to take on another. However if your sim is skilled at another musical interment, they can make additional simoleons licencing music from those individually too!
If the booth is on a residential lot, it will generally function as a stereo, but a Sim will be able to "Be the DJ", which will build creativity. According to the Prima guide for Nightlife, the "House Mix" option will pull MP3s from the Music folder of the player's computer.
The number of genres Sims can play on the DJ booth depends on their level in the DJ mixing skill. The higher their skill, the more genres they can play, and the more interactions become available to them. Sims can also choose to hire a DJ to turn the tables for them, although they will miss out on the opportunity to gain the DJ mixing skill. If nobody is operating the booth it can function as a stereo, but it has access to a limited number of radio stations: Electronica, Hip-Hop, NuDisco[BNS], Pop, Retro and S-Pop.

When your sim is at level 8 of the skill you a re going to unlock the ability to start creating your own mix tapes. This is around an 8 hour project so it is a decent investment of time for your sim. Once you are done with your mix tape you can go to the mailbox and choose to license your song which means you’ll make royalties every day at 10 am for the week.
In Nightlife, a neighborhood will have three pre-made NPC DJs once Downtown is associated with the main neighborhood, and a booth placed on a community lot will use one of them. The player can direct a Sim to be the DJ, and the Sim will earn simoleons while working at the booth. Also, Sims may have a want to work as the DJ.
darn you'd think there would be, considering how many pre-done sims in Windenburg seen to have DJing as their occupation / club when you talk to them . Well at leas they didn't break it up gear in one DLC and the career path in an other. But maybe a future update will have a career path for DJ 'n' dance
To begin you need to get your sims all kitted out to embark on their new DJ mixing adventure, a quick search in the build mode section of your game will give you four options for DJ booths. Its advisable to start with the cheapest one for starting out.

## Create a successful dj career in sims 4.

The DJ Booth returns in The Sims 3: Showtime. Sims will also gain DJ skills from manning the DJ booth. Sims can play four genres from a DJ booth: Dubstep, Drum 'n Bass, Funk, and Niche. Skilled DJs can also hand out Track Mixes similar to albums. There are also opportunities for skilled DJs to perform gigs at venues. If placed on a community lot, it will not spawn an NPC DJ, but a Sim can become one.
The DJ mixing skill was included to the game with the addition of The Sims 4 Get Together expansion pack. With an all new party scene down in the new neighborhood of Windenburg, it seemed only right to add the option to have your sims be the life of the party with some savvy DJ mixing skills! This guide will enable you to master the DJ skill by taking you through the different unlockable abilities as you level up. I also aim to show you how your sims can earn a few simoleons by showing off their new musical mastery!
PracticeThis is the only interaction available at first. The Ideal Mood for a DJ is Inspired, or so it seems - no other mood seemed to help, and it just makes sense. Once you're level 2, you can actually man a booth and allow Sims to dance to your music. At first, your scratching awful noises will not let any Sim get their moves out on the dance floor. Note that you're able to control the volume of the DJ booth for your own personal benefit.
Like most other NPCs in The Sims 4, there are no premade DJs. They are either randomly selected from available townies or generated if there aren't any available. There are two types of DJs: Professional and Headliner. Headliner DJs have maximum DJ mixing skill and wear robotic helmets.
To excel at the DJ Mixing skill your sims will need to practice, a lot! To start with your sims wont sound very good, like with the musical instrument skills when you start out. Being inspired will help your sims level up faster. This is a skill you wont be able to earn money with straight away and cannot be learned through any other method besides old fashioned practice. So if you think being a DJ rookie is going to pay your bills you might wanna think twice. Later on if your sims impress the crowd enough, they will start to earn tips for their musical efforts, these come in very small amounts but they add up as time goes on! Here is what going up each level will unlock:
DJ Mixing is a new Skill included in The Sims 4 Get Together Expansion Pack. This skill allows Sims to entertain large groups at a night club, or in more intimate Club settings. This Guide will teach you about the skill, making money with it, and the abilities you'll gain as you level up as a DJ.
The DJ Mixing skill was added to the game with The Sims 4: Get Together which was the second expansion pack in the series. This pack added a ton of fun things to do with your friends including fun clubs to go to where you can listen to a DJ or become one yourself.
With all skills in The Sims 4, there are skill cheats that you can use to fast forward your progress. Before you can put the DJ Mixing skill cheat in you need to first enable cheats by hitting ctrl + shift + c on your keyboard and type in testingcheats true and hit enter. The game will let you know that cheats are enabled.
