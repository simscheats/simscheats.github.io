## Create a military career in the sims 4 game.

In Sims 4, the Military Career track tasks Sims with raising their Fitness level above all else. However, depending on which of the two branches you pick for your Sim to follow, either recruiting others as an Officer or uncovering the secrets of others as a Covert Operator, they will have to raise either Charisma or Logic, respectively as well. Regardless of your Sim’s path, they will make really solid money compared to other careers and will enjoy a stable five-day work week with eight-hour shifts.

The military career was added to the game as part of The Sims 4: Strangerville and is a great career that can be done from home. Of course the military career came with strangerville since obviously the military would be interested in the weird things happening.
After starting your Military Career, you will complete 5 levels and then be given a choice between two branches and each branch unlocks different career items in Sims 4. Learning how to get a degree in Sims 4 can help you land higher-level jobs. After completing level 5, you choose to be a Covert Operator or an Officer. You will find the details of the first 5 levels given below.
The Military Career was introduced to Sims 4 with the release of the StrangerVille expansion. Until Sims 4 it was a base game career, but its newest inclusion makes it a semi-active career. This means that players have the option to control their Sim during the weekday, but they don’t have to. This works in that an hour before the Sim has to go to work, the player can pick between sending them to work like a traditional “rabbit hole” career or having them work from home and controlling them throughout their shift. If they stay home to work, the Sim is then given two tasks they must complete before the end of their shift to get full job performance.
The Military Career can be challenging to play through, but the Sims that complete it are rewarded with one of the highest salaries in the game and some fantastic, unique items. It also comes with decently consistent work schedules, which can be a savior when finding a work/life balance for your Sims. So, if your want a Sim that does work they can be proud of and make a ton of money from, the Military Career is a perfect option for you to consider.

The Military Career is included with The Sims 4 StrangerVille Game Pack. The new Career features two branches, Officer and Covert Operator which differ quite a bit. One will lead you toward spying on your neighborhood, while the other charges you with getting other recruits into shape. Here's a guide to the new career, its requirements and the rewards you can expect with each promotion. Each one comes with a medal, and there's a display case for storage which can be seen above.

Sims in the Military can use the Spar interaction, which lets them fight in a friendly way with another Sim. This raises fitness and builds relationship between the participants. They also gradually gain access to the 'Order Around' menu which can be used on other Military Sims. You may instruct them to spar one another, among other activities.
Reaching the second level of the Military Career shows that your Sim has started rising through the ranks at their base, catching the attention of their superiors. However, they are still very low on the totem pole, meaning they have to obey orders from anyone above them, which will end up being tasks they won’t want to do. Since your Sim still only needs Fitness to get promoted, you will want to primarily focus on that. However, at this point, you should start working on either Logic or Charisma, depending on your intended branch. Don’t worry about getting it too high, though, since you only need it to be at level four by the time you pick your Sim’s branch.

## Planning your military career in the sims 4 game.

One of my favorite things about the military career in The Sims 4 is that you can work from home! Every morning an hour before you ‘re scheduled to go to work, a dialogue box is going to pop up in the bottom left hand corner of your screen, this is where you’ll choose to either go to work or work from home.
Choosing a Sims career is one of the most important decisions players make during a playthrough. The career that your Sims take on determines what skills they focus on in their free time, how much money they make every shift that they work, what work events they have to deal with, and tangentially influences their personalities and interests. So, choosing the career you want a Sim to follow can be a big decision, especially with the addition of active and semi-active jobs that require players to control the Sim even while they’re at work. So, if you want your Sim to follow the Military Career path you’ll want to make sure you know what you’re getting into.

If you also have the Discover University expansion, you may want to prepare your Sim for the Military Career by having them earn a complimentary degree. When deciding your Sim’s major, you have two options for the Military career depending on which path you ultimately want them to follow.
