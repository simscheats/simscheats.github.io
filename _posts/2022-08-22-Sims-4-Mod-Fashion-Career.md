## Create a fashion career in the sims 4.

We have to start with this real estate custom career mod. A real estate career is one of the most popular careers in Sims 4. With this career, players can learn about how to buy and sell houses. They also get to earn lots of money. It’s not easy though! They have to make sure that their reputation is high and that they meet the different needs of their clients if they want to succeed in this business.

Publishing Fashion Articles for Career Performance
At around level 4 in this career, you can use the 'Careers' menu on a computer to write fashion articles, then publish them. These actually give career performance even when off the clock. If it's a failure you will lose some, but it is very much in your favor as a good piece gives you 50 while a bad one is -30, with it being more likely the article is accepted if your Sim is good at writing and in a good mood.
At level 7 for Trend Setter and 10 for Stylist, you can click your Sim to create masculine or feminine trends. Click the little plus sign in the top right to add an additional trend. When you have an outfit trending other Sims may appear in public, wearing the outfit that you designed. This can help a lot to make ugly townies a little less ugly. You can make up to five each for male/female. When you initially click the plus sign, it adds another and you can also delete them. Click the numbers to switch between trends. This does not seem to interact with the Seasons expansion in any way as far as I can tell.
Updated on June 9, 2022, by Nahda Nabiilah:Thanks to the constant development of The Sims 4, a new Expansion Pack is released from time to time. Some packs add new CAS items, some add furniture, while others add new Careers. Careers are not a must in The Sims 4, as Sims can make money without getting a job. However, it does provide a real-life element and can sometimes make the gameplay more interesting. Therefore, if players wish to play comfortably, searching for the highest paying Career will surely make the experience a lot easier.

When Simmers reach rank six in the Style Influencer Career, the Stylist branch will become available. Once they unlock rank 10, players will have to make their Sim work five days a week for six hours. They'll get $500/hour, $3,000/day, or $15,000/week.
hi, need a little help to complete a daily task, if not bugged. my sims is style influencer and need to "go to gym or park to see clothing/dress", i have the sim at gym, but not understandig what social or action is to complete. tryed ask, interview, model clothes but nothing. any can help?
When Simmers reach a certain rank in a Career, they'll have to choose one of the two branches. Keep in mind, that not all The Sims 4 Careers branch out like the Doctor Career. Sometimes, a Career will have a branch that pays more than the other. There are other Careers that pay by gigs like Interior Design and Actor. However, the amount of money players can make depends on how many gigs they decide to complete.
When your sim reaches level 6 of the stylist career or level 8 of the trend setter career they are now able to start giving other sims make overs. This is great for uglier townies who you just don’t like to look at and is found under friendly interactions.
