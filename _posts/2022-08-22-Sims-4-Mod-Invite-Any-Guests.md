## Create a sims 4 mod that allows guests to join your game without having to create an account.

Always one step ahead, the Sims community has already created a serious mod to bring multiplayer to The Sims 4. The Sims 4 Multiplayer mod is designed to let you play with other people in real-time on a local network. The mod basically uses one PC as a server, which allows two players to join the same game. It's still in closed beta, but the developer has a Patreon (opens in new tab) to support the project and hopes to expand the mod to allow more than two players in the future.

That's why the SimDa Dating App mod is so great. Sims can now use computers and their phone to meet people. Whether they're looking for a blind date or just a quick hook-up, everything is included in this mod. It's not a heavy mod at all, which makes it even better to add into any game for a nice little spice.
Summon Ghosts: Pick ghosts to summon to the lot. Works like inviting a sim over. Note that there must be at least one ghost who exists, who is not already loaded on the lot, for this interaction to be available. You don't have to be introduced to them, but they must exist somewhere.
While fans will still have to wait and see what's in store next for The Sims 4, the best way to enjoy the game right now is to use some of the incredible custom content available. Mods especially can really change the way the game feels and how it's played, which is why these five additional mods deserve some love.

All you need is a lump of clay for your Sims to acquire a Sorcerer trait. From there, you can choose different spells and magic among a wide variety of options available. Your Sims can specialize in different ritual types and use focus spells on Non-Playable Character (NPC) Sims. Definitely, a fun gaming experience!
Added a framework for sims reacting to a spell being casted. Currently, the way this works is you have to manually turn it on per sorcerer in the Spells (Cheat) Reaction menu. It also has only a 1 in 10 chance of occurring for any given nearby sim, when you cast a spell. I did it this way because it was going to be either this or make it something that is on by default and you can toggle it off per sim. I didn't want to annoy people with something that could turn out to be repetitive and annoying over a long period of time, so instead you can try it out if you want to and if you don't like it, you can just never enable it in the future on your sorcerer sims. If it goes in a direction where people really like it, I might consider trying to work out a way to make it easier to turn on, rather than having to enable it for each individual sorcerer.
For those who have always dreamed of replicating their childhood sleepovers in The Sims 4, there's good news. The Sleepover Mod introduces a new event type, which allows children to plan a sleepover event with a friend. The event can even be made for toddlers, but an adult Sim will have to plan it.
GAME-RATED CONTENT ONLY
Mods that breaks the T-for-Teen game rating CANNOT be named or discussed in these official Sims forums. It’s against Forum Rules. Some creators of these mods also won’t be reported here depending on how sending you to their content works. Please see creators’ own social media.

## Establish a system for inviting guests into your game, without having to rely on modding.

Prevent overpopulation.Always run your game with mods to reduce overpopulation, create townie-free custom neighborhoods, and avoid deleting Sims through the Sim Bin or moving Sims across neighborhoods (as this creates excessive amount of "stub" files that the OS has to open).
There are a number of mods and programs, created by skilled modders, that can help reduce corruption. They have little to no impact on gameplay, and are highly unlikely to conflict with other mods. Instructions on how to install most mods can be found here.

Introducing Reality Arts ranked skill. This functions like specializations in that it's not a visible skill and ranks up with XP. Unlike specializations, it doesn't decay and when you reach Grandmaster, you can continue to rank up to get more Reality Motes.
Pets tend to be a popular addition, and with each game since the very first one, players have always eagerly awaited for the pets expansion to pop up. Unfortunately, pets can't be controlled, nor can their needs really be seen. While this is more realistic, it can be a bit annoying at times.
In the meantime, a super mod known as Slice Of Life provides tons and tons of changes into the game to make it more playable. From custom traits to new interactions and changes to emotions and buffs, this mod will affect every aspect of a Sim's life. It's perfect for those who just want one mod to do all the good things.
Neglecting to do most of this probably isn't going to be very noticeable, since most of the components of the mod depend on you being a Sorcerer for it to matter. The ones I most recommend doing are releasing any Minions from service and any Sims in Stasis Field, so they don't get stuck in the situation.
