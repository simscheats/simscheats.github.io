## Create custom sims 4 mods.

If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)

Many of the best Sims 4 mods affect the ways Sims interact with each other. The Sims 4 has a long list of traits that change the way a Sim behaves, and because they’re relatively easy for modders to create you can quickly expand that list through custom content.
If you’re a player that likes to have a lot of your own sims in your world or you get annoyed with boring NPCs, this mod is made specifically for you. It allows you to “fill up” a non-played sim’s life by randomly assigning them a career, traits, skills, etc., so they’re no longer a blank slate.
Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
I’ve compiled this list of the mods that I must have in my sims 4 game. Some of these are super tiny mods that fix one annoying little thing and some are massive mods that can completely alter your sims’ world. The best part is: all of these are free mods.

This is a sims 4 mod bundle that contains four mods that will alter the sim’s education system. The first part is the preschool mod, which I’ve talked a bit about below. The second part is the better school mods which has their sims build skills while at school. It also gives them more interactions such as play games on their phone or flirt with classmates.
This handy mod by Weerbesu makes using Sims 4 cheats a breeze if you don't know the lot by heart. Right-clicking various parts of the normal Sims 4 interface will give you extra options for things like giving a household more money, promoting Sims in their careers, or changing the in-game time. You can find the full list of features by scrolling down a bit on the download page.
This Sims 4 mod is all about adding more complexity to character romance and interactions, letting you tweak the traits they find attractice in others, dating preferences, and even attitude towards birth control. Wonderful Whims adds a whole extra layer to the Sims 4 dating experience, giving it a little extra depth and less superficiality.
Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.

## Facilitate mod downloading and installation.

From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.
Always check out the installation instructions for any mod you download just to be sure there aren't any more additional steps. Most should just be a quick matter of copying files over. Do keep an eye out for any dependencies your mods have, such as meshes creates by other modders that you'll also need to install.
This mod will save your settings for it in a .cfg file that will be generated in the same folder as the mod. You can open it at any time with a standard text editor (window’s Notepad for example) to see that, indeed, it has nothing in it but the settings the mod needs to work.
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.
The Welcome Home portion of this mod is so cool! Whenever you play a household for the first time after installing this mod, your house will be completely dark with no electricity, no water, no garbage collection, no TV, no internet, and no cellphone. You’ll need to go into the SNB Bills app to pick a package and set up your services. These range from basic to premium. With the premium package, you’ll get faster internet and more TV channels.
The third part of the download is the smarter homework mod. Your sims will now build skills while doing homework, because why shouldn’t they get something out of it? And the fourth, and final part, adds online schooling. This mod holds a special place in my heart because I actually went to an online high school and loved it! To go to online school, your sims will need access to the ‘School Only PC’ which you’ll find in buy mode after download.
It is advised to NOT do assignments for orientation in CAS, but to do it all through this mod instead – because the mod has more options that CAS can’t handle at all!(it will also adjust the cas stuff, and vice versa).The mod has a convenient all-in-one system for assignments so it’s fast and easy to make them.
If the idea of downloading and installing WickedWhims doesn’t appeal to you, well you can install WonderfulWhims instead. This mod offers lots of relationship enhancements, including an attractiveness system. Use it to define your attraction preferences.
