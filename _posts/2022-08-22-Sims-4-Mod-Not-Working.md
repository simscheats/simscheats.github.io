## Mod not working

Bad mods: If there are any corrupt or bad mods in your mods directory, there is a possibility that the entire batch of mods will not work. Here we have to apply a technique where we test each mod one by one to find the culprit and disregard it from the folder.

Every game has a cache folder which it uses for its operations and the running of the game. Since the cache files are created at runtime and may be leftover, there are chances that some of them get corrupt. When this occurs, the game causes unexpected behavior including the mods not working as required. In this solution, we will navigate to the cache folder and clear it.
Sometimes for better organization, you create some subfolders in the Mods folder. If you do this, make sure you have placed files with format .package and .ts4script only one folder deep in the Mods folder, not deeper. Anything that will be placed deeper might not be recognized by the game! So this can be the reason why the mod is not working, not showing up, or working only partially.
Mod files in .zip format: The mod files which you download through the internet are in a zipped format. In order to properly place them in the correct location, you need to unzip them and then place the contents. If this isn’t the case, the mods will fail to work.
There is a potential that your installed mod is totally functional but is not visible on the screen, rendering it inaccessible. This can occur as a result of multiple game updates that you may have installed, which rendered other modifications inoperable. To resolve this, make sure that both the "Script Mods Allowed" and "Enable Custom Content and Mods" boxes in your game settings are checked. In the game, go to Options Game Options Other to access these options.

If the mod itself needs an update, make sure to leave a comment about it on its download page. However, if there is no issue with compatibility, try checking whether the mod package is unzipped. Depending on your PC operating system, the instructions for unzipping a folder differ slightly.
I downloaded Some script mods, but they don't really work. I downloaded the royalty mod, the professor mod, the road to fame mod. They all show up in the CC/ Mods list but the only one that really came through was the professor mod and that doesn't really do what i thought it would either. I guess I didn't download them correctly but when I looked it up on youtube they did exactly what I did. Please help. Thx.CM Edit: Please don't discuss or promote mods that are against the Answers HQ Guidelines. Thanks.
Hi so I’m having a similar problem. On my windows 10, I downloaded all my mods accordingly, put them in the mods folder, and played about 2 months ago. However, this afternoon, the mods were not working. I deleted them all after trying to re-zip the files, then re-downloaded them. I did the same things to install them but they’re still not showing up whatsoever and it’s really annoying lol. Anyone can help me with this? Also, please simplify any answers im really stupid lol...
Before we start with any other solution, we will check whether the mod files which you have placed in the mods folder are in the correct format. Normally, the format in which the mod files are when you download them from the creator’s website is .zip. The reason why the game cannot view and operate the contents of the .zip file is that the game engine is not designed to unzip the package each and every time as this will consume a lot of time and CPU energy.

## Sims 4 not loading

Are you facing trouble in accessing/opening/loading the Sims 4? Is this taking place after the update? Read this article where we talk about the possible causes and the fix for this error. Therefore read the details carefully as you might be able to track the triggering source and solve the error.
@Queen_Mia1228 Do you run the standard version of Sims 4, or the Legacy Edition? If you have the standard version, you'll need to make sure your mods are fully updated for the current patch. If you have the LE, you'll need to specifically download mods made for or confirmed to be compatible with the LE; the newer ones won't work.
If all the above methods don’t work, there is a chance that your Sims 4 copy have corrupt/incomplete installation files which are causing the game to malfunction. Games constantly update every once in a while to improve bugs or to add new features. It is possible that while updating the game modules, some of them didn’t get installed correctly or have missing files. We will try repairing the game so all of this can be fixed by the client itself.
In this case, you should create a new household and check if it can load the mods. If Sims 4 mods not working issue disappear, it will be sure that this issue is caused by the household problem. You can give up the original household and use the new one.
Sims 4 files are stored in two folders, one located in Program Files and the second one in Documents/Electronic Arts/TheSims4. Check the second location. If the folder is not there, chances are you’ve accidentally deleted it, or the game failed to create it. Not to worry – that’s fixable.
@itsmaayyaa It could be that some of those .script mods are obsolete. Obsolete mods can definitely cause problems with your game and even ruin game saves. We'll have to deal with those later as first we need to get your game running again without any mods or CC.Please try the following in this exact order without skipping any steps, even if you’ve done some of these steps already:Make a copy of your entire The Sims 4 folder in Documents/Electronic Arts to an external drive or a temp folder somewhere else in your Documents folder. This part is very important because this is your backup for your Save and Tray files for if anything goes wrong. Keep it in a safe place that you will remember where it is and don't make any changes to it for now.In your Electronic Arts/The Sims 4 folder temporarily move your Mods folder onto your desktop and delete the localthumbcache.package file. Also delete any other folders in the The Sims 4 folder with word "cache" in the name. Don't restart your game yet, but when we get to that part the game will automatically create a new Mods folder and auto-generate a new localthumbcache file. The new Mods folder will be empty but no worries you can bring everything back in later.Repair your game through Origin [ Open Origin, click 'My Game Library' then right-click The Sims 4 icon and select Repair ]. Make sure to let it run until it has completed all repairs (it will do the base-game first, then run through each of your expansions/packs). This might take a few minutes depending on your computer and how many packs you have but let it go until it finishes.Do not re-add any of your Mods or CC at this time.Start your game and select New Game and see if everything looks to be running ok without mods or CC. Make a new household, play around a bit. This is just for a test, if everything looks good you can exit without saving (you can try to play your old saves later, for now we are just trying to get your game to work).Before re-adding any of your mods, please check the mod creators' websites to see if there are any updated versions or at least a verification that the older mods are still compatible with the latest game patch. Follow any special instructions they provide on how to install their mods. I use Mod Trackers like the one at Simsonic Sims 4 to check the statuses of all the mods I use in my game.https://simsonic.weebly.com/modtracker.htmlLet us know how all this works out. Good luck I hope this helps :D
Hence you should navigate to the mod’s website and make sure that the mod which you downloaded is indeed that of Sims 4 and not of the earlier versions. You can easily check this by seeing the changelog or the category in which they are placed. Identify the incompatible mods and remove them.
Many people have also been successful in resolving difficulties with their modifications by just restarting the game folder. To do it manually, just rename the Sims 4 game folder located in your computer's document directory. When you do this, the game will generate a new folder and present you with a clean version the next time it runs. After checking that the game is functioning properly, just re-copy the essential files to your game folder.
