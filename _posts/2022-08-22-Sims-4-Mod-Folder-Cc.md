## The sims 4 mod folder cc allows players to create and share custom content with other players.

About Mods and Custom ContentMods and Custom Content are wildly popular among Sims 4 players, but if you're new to the franchise you may be unaware what treasures await those who ravenously scour the web for the latest downloads. There is far more free content available to download than is included in the base game and all game/stuff packs combined. In this guide, I'll teach you how to install CC and mods, explain what they are and offer some direction on where to go from here by providing links to sites where you can binge-download CC for your game.

If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)
The Mods FolderNext, find or create the Mods folder. It should already be there, but if it's not you can right click in the white area within The Sims 4 folder and create a folder, being sure to name it Mods. The game automatically recognizes and attempts to utilize anything in this folder. So, once we download CC, we'll copy the files to that folder. Tip: You can have other folders inside the Mods folder, so if you'd like to separate out your CC and Mods in to separate folders, or even categorize them by object/clothing type, you can do so! Additionally, Forum member RandyH notes that it's possible to rename mods so long as you keep the .package at the end of the file name. This can make your organization even simpler, and possibly help you track things down easier. All of this is actually a good idea should you run into a mod or piece of CC that gives you trouble, so that it's easier to find and remove.
Custom content and general mods: These files end in .package. Open the Mod folder the game has created (Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods) and copy all the mod files into the folder. You can create additional subfolders to organize your growing mod collection better.
Mods are an excellent way to customize your Sims’ lives further and bring new challenges and items into the game. You’ll usually have more problems finding the content you like and installing it into the game. That’s a part of Sims 4’s charm. With so many community members, new custom content is available frequently.

Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
That’s everything you need to know about Sims 4 custom content. If you’re looking for general Sims 4 mods, we’ve got an excellent guide for that. We’ve also got a Sims 4 cheats list if you’re looking for some help running your sim’s lives. Failing that, why not read up on what we want from The Sims 5, should Maxis decide to give us another iteration.
