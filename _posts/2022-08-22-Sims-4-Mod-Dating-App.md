In The Sims 2: Nightlife, dating is a mini-game scenario involving two Sims. A Sim's date will follow him/her and do activities together while they fill up the date meter and fulfill their wants before the time runs out. The mechanism is similar to that of a party, but dating can be done on a community lot and only involves two Sims. The key is to do fun things together and avoid dating disasters.
This is how I did it probably not ideal if you want to see them approach the target sim I had good friends with Zoe Patel so I clicked under friendly options hook up with it was an NPC sim I can't remember his name so she went up to him and he dismissed her advances so I waited until the next day asked her again this time the target sim was not on the lot a few sim hours later I got a text from her saying that she and the NPC sim were dating so try asking when the the sim you want to hook up with is not on the lot because when they are it rarely works.
One Sim can ask another to go Downtown, either in person or over the telephone. A Sim who is already Downtown can approach another Sim and say "Let's Date" or "Let's Hang Out". The controllable Sim will be able to use the "Ask About Mood" interaction to determine which motive his or her date wants to fulfill at that moment.
After choosing any of the two options and a partner, you need to find a location to meet. Based on how your date went, you would have a good, bad, or an excellent first date. For adding your relationship, the sim needs to be around her date for a moment, even after the date ends. If they had an excellent date, you would always remember it due to your special relationship. A relationship cheat is what you need at this point of time.

Check if you subsequent the installation guiding correctly without lacking out on any stage. One reason might be that script mod is mounted too profound into the mods file, or script adjustment is disabled. The flaw can disable these elect in simda dating app sims 4.
A date meter that shows on the upper right of the screen shows that Sim is on a date. It displays the date score, the partner's thumbnail, and the partner's aspiration symbol. Clicking the partner's aspiration symbol will expand or collapse a display that shows his or her wants and fears. The date score ranges over seven tiers:
After a Sim goes on a date with another Sim, sometimes the Sim who was asked on the date will make a call and ask if you want to go on a date again. Somehow, this makes a small glitch. When two non-townie teens have gone on dates and one of the teens become a young adult, the Sim could make a call and ask out on date again, even though they are in different life stages. This causes many romantic interactions to be limited or not appear at all. The wants could only be to talk, entertain, and play with. This won't make both Sims fall in love either.
Similar to WooHoo, a date in progress is "detectable" by all Sims present on the lot, even if the dating Sims are not within sight. This means that non-monogamous Sims must be cautious about dating at community lots; if another partner walks onto the lot at any point, he or she will promptly discover the cheating, become furious and run to slap the offending Sim (the date in itself is considered cheating, even if no romantic interactions have occurred).
