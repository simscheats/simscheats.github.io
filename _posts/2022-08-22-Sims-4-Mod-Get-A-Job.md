## Install a mod that allows sims to get jobs.

If you don’t want your sims working stressful jobs and having 8 hour days, you also have the option of choosing a part time job instead of a full blown career. These are jobs that are only a few hours a day and can be easily completed daily while also pursing dreams of art or writing or raising a family. These jobs are also available for teens to participate in after school or on weekends.

Another one from Zerbu, the Turbo Careers mod makes all adult (and two teen) careers function like the active careers from the Get to Work expansion. You can download work venues from the Gallery, including ones with a combined function, or make your own—just make sure they have the right objects for Sims to do their job.
With over 363,000 downloads at ModTheSims, the Self-Employment Career Mod is definitely one of the popular ones in the Sims community. This mod is created by Neia, an active mod maker with many other career mods included in this list. This mod mainly fills the career panel for self-employed Sims when asked what they do for a living. I like this mod because it undoubtedly adds something valuable and unique to the game. It is unavailable in the basic game. Give this mod a chance too, and it is really worth a try! You only need just the base game to use this one. You may download the file at ModTheSims.
Sometimes when you are playing you may just not want your sims to work for a specific career any longer, or you may just want to stay at home or pursue your passion. In order to quit your job in the sims you want to go to your phone and in the career panel there will be a quit job option. You’ll get a pop up asking if you are sure that you want to do this, and you can say yes or no. Beware because some sims are going to be sad if they quit their job!
There are going to be two branches of this career to choose from, the first one is diamond agent. In this branch you are going to need to continue to gain the charisma and logic skills. Oddly enough, the daily task you’ll need to do is participate in romantic interactions with other sims.

We know how sometimes it feels a bit frustrating when the career and job options in The Sims 4 are limited. Good thing tons of awesome job and career mods are easily available for download – thanks to the creative minds of mod creators! If you’re on the hunt for the best Sims 4 job and career mods, we’ve got some good news! This article puts together the best one we’ve found across several sources. Check them out below!
When your sims are at work you actually have the option of choosing how they are working. As a default each day your sims will start off by just working normally. This will decrease their fun need at a regular rate and they won’t be in an awesome mood when they get home.
Answer: Not exactly, but the best I can find is this mod by LittleMsSim (one of the best creators out there, I plan to add more of her mods to this article soon!) which allows you to hire whomever you want in the restaurant, including your household sims: https://littlemssam.tumblr.com/post/175404064663/h...
To change the way your sim is working you can click on the small briefcase icon that is on the grayed out image of your sim on the bottom panel. You’ll have the option to work hard, take it easy, socialize, and more depending on your career. If you choose to socialize your social need will go up and you may meet people and make friends. If you choose to take it easy your sims fun need will go up but their work performance won’t improve.

## Look for sims mods that give players new ways to interact with the game.

If you're fed up with your Sims having meaningless chit-chats with each other, then this mod from PolarBearSims (opens in new tab) could be just the ticket to spice up their interactions. This extensive mod introduces many changes, but one of the key features is removing idle chat from conversations. This means that instead of nattering, your Sims will have to interact with each other, and the mod will decide how this goes down based on the existing relationship between the Sims, plus their character traits and current mood. Sit back and watch how things pan out, but prepare for fireworks if two Sims don't get along.
This handy mod by Weerbesu makes using Sims 4 cheats a breeze if you don't know the lot by heart. Right-clicking various parts of the normal Sims 4 interface will give you extra options for things like giving a household more money, promoting Sims in their careers, or changing the in-game time. You can find the full list of features by scrolling down a bit on the download page.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
The options for mods are pretty diverse. I've seen everything from one for The Sims 2 which added horses to the game (and yes, Sims could even ride them—and this was way before the Pets expansion pack added horses to The Sims 3), to one for Sims 3 which added in a working Ferris wheel. Some are much less complex, just restructuring the regular game files to add in or change things (like a Sims 3 mod which allows late-night bars to stay open 24 hours instead of closing at 2 a.m., or the most famous mod of all, the one that removes the pixelation on nude Sims and replaces it with body parts).
I have to mention Neia's career mods! She's created several new "realistic" careers for the game, like Law Career, Education Career, Architect, Military and even a Self-Employment Career. These are some great options for players who enjoy more realistic gameplay, rather than having Sims who have the outlandish sort of jobs that come in the game (I mean, come on—not everyone grows up to be an astronaut or rock star!).
Want to give your Sims the lifestyle of the rich and famous? Then try out Sacrificial Road to Fame mod! This mod adds tons of new gameplay, including skills (Simstagram Skill), fame levels, buffs, new interactions and animations, fans and paparazzi and more!
