## Sims 4 mod folder is missing and game won't start.

@chloherm714Did your folder get deleted or does your mods not show up in game? The file directory is your folder, what exactly are you asking for?Usually you have the mods in C:\Users\Username\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\mods, if you deleted them, check your trash can.If you have the mods in the folder but they're not showing up in game:I guess you double checked that script mods and cc were activated in the game options? Both of them?And then you have mods that do not work? All mods or just some? If it's just some mods that do not work, which ones?If no mods show up in your gameDid you place them in C:\Users\Username\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\ModsDo the game register that there are mods? Do they show up in the list in the beginning or if you open the mods list from the options menu?Do you have OneDrive on your computer? Make sure that the game is not using the OneDrive-folders. Try turning off OneDrive before starting the game.You can check where the game saves your files by looking in your Game Options - Screenshot settings.Make sure that the path above is the same place as where you have your saves and mods.

Sims 4 files are stored in two folders, one located in Program Files and the second one in Documents/Electronic Arts/TheSims4. Check the second location. If the folder is not there, chances are you’ve accidentally deleted it, or the game failed to create it. Not to worry – that’s fixable.
After you've launched the game, the folder will be in Documents/Electronic Arts -- then inside the Sims 4 folder you'll find the Mods folder along with all the other folders needed. You don't have to start a game save, just go to the opening main menu screen then go up to Options (the three dots in the upper right corner of the screen) and select Exit Game.
When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.

Well first, check your Trash/Recycling Bin on your computer to see if it's still there. Make sure whenever CC is installed you have "Enable Custom Content And Mods" checked, and some CC even requires "Enable Script Mods" to be checked too. If your mods folder isn't in the Trash/Recycling Bin, and you have all of the CC you want to put back in there, just go into the Sims 4 directory where you'd normally put CC, and create a folder and name it "Mods" (With the capital "M") and then put your items in there. I hope I was clear enough, and I hope you get your problem solved! Cheers!
After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
Okay so I've launched the game and everything, but I still cant find my Sims 4 folder... I'm on Windows 10 and I think that may be part of the problem... help please! @kaatedocus said: Okay so I've launched the game and everything, but I still cant find my Sims 4 folder...

I have been playing sims 4 for some time now and i wish to add mods to it, however i find that every mod instructs people to put there files in the mod folder. However i cannot find such folder as it seems that i my game has installed in the origin's game folder and not in the Electronic arts folder (which is were everyone else's game seems to be) and thus the folders are completely different and in some cases missing like the mod folder.How do i install the sims 4 in the electronic arts folder? hope by doing so will fix my problem but i have tried to re-install the game several times and searched for an option to change it but i cant seem to find one...

## Sims 4 won't start, mods not loading.

In this case, you should create a new household and check if it can load the mods. If Sims 4 mods not working issue disappear, it will be sure that this issue is caused by the household problem. You can give up the original household and use the new one.
Finally, uninstalling and reinstalling the Sims 4 is the last resort to fix mods notworking problem. You can completely remove the Sims 4 from your computer and then download the latest version of the game from the official website. Then, install the game according to the given instruction and check if Sims 4 mods not showing up issue is removed.
@the_music_queen0 Please go into Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4, and confirm that there's no Mods folder. If there isn't, load the game, enable mods and cc, then quit. If these settings are already enabled, disable them, quit, then reload and reenable them. This should create a new Mods folder with a resource.cfg file inside. (If it doesn't, delete options.ini from your Sims 4 folder, load the game, enable mods and cc, and quit. But you'll need to reset your other in-game options as well.)When adding mods, be sure to test them in small batches, so you know they still work properly and don't crash your game. If one batch causes problems, you'll need to split it and keep testing until you find the issue. It's often easier to just download fresh copies of any mods you want to use. Their download pages should stat whether they've been updated for or confirmed to work with the current patch level, currently 1.60.
Did you try going to Game Options then click other and Enable Custom contents and Mods, if you use script mods you should also allow that, apply, then restart?If that does not work check for broken Mods. You can remove them and just add your Mods back in small bunches. Check after each bunch until you find the bad ones. Mods need to be checked with every new patch or they can cause issues.EA does support using Mods and CC, but you use them at your own risk.If your game runs well without your Mods and CC. you may need to check each one to find the one that causes problems, with every new patch.Then you can contact the Mods and CC creators for updates or solutions to the problem with their creation.Also, check the sims forum its a lot of help their for Mods and CC.https://forums.thesims.com/en_US/categories/the-sims-4Hope this helps, I am not an EA employee I am just trying to help. So if it did help please grant XP points ty.
Corrupt current gameplay: Sims 4 allows users to create several different households. We came across some cases where the household itself was corrupt and it failed to load any new mods. Loading a new household and checking there will confirm the situation.
Hence you should navigate to the mod’s website and make sure that the mod which you downloaded is indeed that of Sims 4 and not of the earlier versions. You can easily check this by seeing the changelog or the category in which they are placed. Identify the incompatible mods and remove them.
We have received numerous reports regarding the issue where Sims 4 mods fail to work. Either the game doesn’t pick up the mod files which you have pasted in the directory or the mod fails to initialize. We looked at several user reports and use cases to come to the conclusion that this issue occurred due to several different reasons.
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
