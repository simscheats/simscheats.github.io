## How to install a sims 4 mod pack

Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.

Next, launch The Sims 4. Now ask yourself, “What mods do I want to discard?” To figure out which mods you want to keep from these packs, find an empty lot on the world menu and select “Build.” It can be any empty lot. Once loaded into your empty lot, start placing the custom content onto the lot.
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
Remember that game mods and custom content are designed to work with genuine versions of The Sims 4. There is no guarantee that they will work with pirated versions of the game, so if you do have a pirated version and a mod isn't working, that could be why. The only way to fix this would be to buy a copy of The Sims 4 directly from Origin, where you can ensure the game will be patched regularly and compatible with all mods and custom content.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).

Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
Check that the mod itself is up-to-date. With the Sims 4, nearly every time a patch comes out, it breaks a variety of mods. Usually, the mod's creator will be aware of this and will update their website to notify players of this. Check the page you downloaded the mod from and then delete and reinstall the new version, if necessary. Sims websites like SimsVIP also keep a running tab of incompatible mods and CC after patches.

Copy the package file you created to the Sims 4 mods folder. 14. Open The Sims 4 and enable mods under "Others" in the "Game Options" menu. 15. Restart your game. 16. Load a Sims 4 game and click the "Manage households" icon in the upper-right corner of the map screen. 17. Select a household and click the pencil icon. 18. Select a Sim, and the item type you created. 19. Locate item you created in the menu to the left and click it.
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.

## How to uninstall a sims 4 mod pack

@SantaFeAtBay You can delete the mods fully by opening your Sims 4 folder in My Documents and in the mod folder delete all mods, in your case you can just delete the entire folder. You will then need to clear the Sims 4 cache which you can do by deleting the file localthumbscache.package which is the folder in which your Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/ cache can be found.You also need to delete all files that end in .cache but leave the actual directory. Now go ahead and go back to thecachestr folder. Delete all of the files but once again do not delete the actual directory.If you see a folder called onlinethumbnailcache then you can go ahead and trash it too.
If your mods are not functioning properly in Sims 4, there are some free tools created by the modding community that will help you find and delete the files. The process can be tedious, but the best way is using Sims 4 Studio (a free tool for making custom content) and Sims 4 Tray Importer.
This will open the Mods folder and automatically highlight the file you selected in Sims 4 Tray Importer. Just right-click the file and delete it. The Sims 4 Tray Importer will automatically delete the files in your Mods folder for you, but only if you downloaded the separated .package file instead of the merged file. If you downloaded the merged .package file, all of the mods will be deleted.
In the case that you do need to delete a file that you've merged, if you've kept the un-merged files copied somewhere, simply delete the individual file you want to get rid of, and delete the merged .package file from your Mods folder. Then go back into Sims 4 Studio, merge the remaining files as explained above and then put the new merged .package file into your Mods folder.
Help! I deleted my Sims mod file long ago and it never reappeared. I never saw any Sim with those hairstyle or clothes. Everything was great.Suddenly it reappeared! I got the warning blurb when I logged into Sims 4.I don't need or want those mods or any mods. How do I delete it? I've looked everywhere. I can't find it.Now my Sims game just flashes and flashes. Not lightning flashes. Error flashes. I cannot play it as the screen keeps jerking with these flashes. Please help me find and delete this file.
To delete CAS items like hair, clothes, etc., launch The Sims 4, and select “Create A New Household.” Filter your custom content, and choose the items you want to delete from your Mods folder, including any broken mods in your game. To make this super easy, make sure to only dress your Sim in items that you want to delete.
Try deleting your .cache files. To do this, go into Documents Electronics Arts The Sims 4 folder. You can delete the localthumbscache.package file in this directory. You'll also see a folder titled cache and one titled cachestr. You can delete everything in these folders, but not the folder themselves. You may also safely delete the entire onlinethumbnailcache folder, if present. Deleting cache files allows the game to "fix" itself in a way, and can be done as a first resort before repairing your entire game.
There’s a simple fix for this using The Sims 4 Tray Importer. First, go to “Create a Sim” screen and remove everything from the same category on every outfit. Our goal is to only have equipped default items. By clicking “X” on each clothing category, you can remove all equipped items from the Sim.
