## How to earn and keep royalty in sims 4 modding

Depending on your gameplay interests, you may want to consider a tweak to the reputation system, which the Sims 4 Royalty mod gameplay is based upon (and comes with Sims 4: Get Famous). The Faster/Slower/No Decay mod by ClaudiaSharon allows you to freeze a Sims’ reputation where it is, or make the decay slower or faster.

To download Royalty Mod for The Sims 4 you must click this link. It takes you to the author's Patreon. Once you are on the page, go down to about the middle of the page. There you will find links to two mods - XML Injector and Trait Injector - which are required for Royalty Mod to work, and the files for the mod itself.
Only a few fortunate ones have Regality bequeath to them. To your aww and gratification, you can have it for yourself without putting in much effort in sims 4. Whether it’s a colossal mansion you want for yourself or an Elephant that can play guitar, there’s nothing that a monarch title cannot buy. The Sims 4 Royalty mod will help you transform your sims’ world into a royal one. The enticing features of this mod can convince anyone to try it out. So, let’s start this royal journey!
One downside to the Sims 4 Royalty mod is that it’s a little lacking in the CAS and Build/Buy category, making it hard to create an authentic kingdom. Whether you chose to go for a more modern or historical take, you can fulfill aesthetic needs through a combination of packs and custom content.
The main concept of the Sims 4 Royalty mod is a gameplay package that allows you to play out a monarchy, with the ability to exact titles, impose a tax system, build a reputation, and establish heirs for the throne. While mostly focused on gameplay, the Sims 4 Royalty mod also comes with a few CAS items to get you started in creating a somewhat ambiguous historical aesthetic. As a gameplay mod, the Sims 4 Royalty mod itself is classified as a script mod.

Helpful: If you’ve been playing with Royal families before today, you will need to cheat the game to add the Royal Allowance trait to your Sim as your Sims already have titles. This is a hidden trait and you will need MC Command Center to make sure your cheated are added. Then select your Sim using shift + control + enter and select add trait. Then add the “Royal Allowance” hidden trait.
2 - your sims have to be designated as a noble by the monarch in order for the game to give them the nobility traits. I’m not sure if this is still the case, but once your sim is designated as a noble, they can move up the ranks by increasing their fame (Get Famous is a HARD requirement for llazyneiph’s royalty mod and it will not function properly without it)
The Royalty Mod has a wonderful title system which actually lets you pick the title of your Sims. For example, your monarch can be a King, Emperor, Tsar or a Sultan and their spouse Queen, Tsarina, Princess. All of these are changeable during playing and it only takes seconds for the new title to take place! Aside from the monarch title which you get when creating that Sim, all the other titles are bestowed in the game by the monarch. He is the one who can change the title of another Sim, for example uplifting a peasant to a Noble.
You can click the career image above to download the career. It’s important to note that if Sims go into a work rabbit hole with a Royal title, an error will occur. This is because Sims have “Titles” and the titles over their heads are considered “Situation jobs” so it conflicts with career and school rabbitholes. I am still looking for a way around this (But highly unlikely to be fixed because of the way the game is programmed) – and this is why the Royal Gigs career should be used for your Sims who hold titles. To find this career Freelancer Royal Family Trade this will allow your Sim to select Royal duties to complete. To find out more about this career click here!
