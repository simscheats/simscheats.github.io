## Discord is a great way to stay in touch with sims 4 modders.

Announcing the Sims Community Discord Server – a place where you can do all that plus more! This Discord server is a collection of mutliple different channels that allow you to chat with all your fellow Simmers, share your creations, Mods, CC, Stories, Videos, Streams – basically ANYTHING Sims related.

~currently modding & mod support is my main work; your support ensures that I can continue~Hello, I am Lumpinou! I make Sims 4 mods to enhance your experience. Recently acquired physical limitations have put a huge dent in my creative hopes and professional options. Modding for the Sims is my newfound way to still be creative. If you enjoy my mods – any support you can give would be more than appreciated.
Mods are an excellent way to customize your Sims’ lives further and bring new challenges and items into the game. You’ll usually have more problems finding the content you like and installing it into the game. That’s a part of Sims 4’s charm. With so many community members, new custom content is available frequently.
For those who are out of the Discord loop – Discord is a social networking platform available on both desktops and smartphones that allows you to meet up with fellow gaming community members. The tools within the Discord platform have been specifically adjusted to suit any gamer so they can meet fellow gamers and share their passion for their favorite video game.
Discord is a multi-platform online text and voice chat service. Discord allows users across the world to text chat in real-time, similar to on-wiki Chat and IRC (Internet Relay Chat). Unlike Wiki Chat or IRC, Discord also allows users to transmit audio in real-time. Voice chat is especially popular with gamers, and Discord is designed to run alongside games and has an in-game overlay interface (similar to Steam and Origin).

Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
Many Sims 4 players enjoy how the game looks and works as-is. However, members of the online Sims community have spent countless hours developing content to enrich and enhance the game and bring it to new heights. Mods allow you to get new features out of a game and change how some old functions work.
You will need to pay attention to where you are getting the mods from. There are commonly used websites such as Mod the Sims, TwistedMexi, and Sims 4 Studio. However, there are a lot of simmers who upload mods to their own blogs, GitHubs, and io pages.
You should also know that whenever The Sims 4 gets a patch (usually at the same time as a new EA approved DLC is implemented), that update can 'break' cc so they don't work as well as they used to. Maybe your Sim will no longer sleep in the top bunk of your cc bunk beds, that kind of thing. If that happens, you should check the mod page on The Sims Resource or any social media pages the creator has - they'll usually be aware or let you know if they're working on an update.

## Discord can be a great way to collaborate on mods.

Discord can be run through web browsers such as Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, or it can be run through a downloadable standalone client; links to open Discord in-browser or to download the client are available at discordapp.com. Registration is required in order to use Discord. Most features and services on Discord, including registering an account, joining or creating a server, participating on a server, and private messaging other users, are free.
Check for mod incompatibility: If you’re using several mods, try using only half of them at a time to check if the issues persist. Changing the selection of mods you use at once can show which mod is the culprit. In some cases, the underlying game programming means some mods simply can’t work together at all, and you’ll need to choose which ones to keep.
Mods can be a lot of fun to use & I have quite a few of them but they do require some special precautions.Be aware that outdated mods can break your game even without viruses. If you are going to use them, my advice is to only add a few at a time and keep careful notes on which ones you are adding and where you found them. This will make it easier to check for updates later on.After adding a mod, keep an eye out for anything that looks wrong in your game. If something looks wrong, stop playing and do not save. Immediately go back and delete the mod from your Mods folder and then delete the localthumbcache.package file from your Sims 4 folder (this is very important). In fact, you should delete that localthumbcache file every time you make any change to your Mods folder. No worries, the game will auto-generate a new cache file the next time you launch Sims 4.Also keep an eye out for Last Exceptions files in your Sims 4 folder as they can be a good indicator that you are using an outdated mod & it is causing script errors.Finally, make sure you temporarily remove all mods and CC prior to installing a game patch. This means you'll want to make sure that the "Automatic game updates" setting is disabled in Origin to allow you the chance to move out the mods before the patch downloads. Keep in mind that just because a mod has been working fine for a long time, it does not automatically mean it will still work after a game patch. Always check for mod updates after installing a game patch.There are a couple of broken mod/CC trackers that I use. One tracker is on the Sims 4 Forum that is posted by luthienrising:https://forums.thesims.com/en_US/discussion/968717/broken-updated-mods-cc-university-editionThe other tracker I use is on a site called Simsonic Sims:https://simsonic.weebly.com/mods.htmlIf all this sounds like a lot of work, well maybe it is, but it is nothing compared with trying troubleshoot and fix a game after it has been broken by an outdated mod.P.S. I usually use the sites @Psychotps mentioned :D
Once you start downloading mods, you may not want to stop. However, you should note that some mods don’t play well with other ones. In severe cases, the game won’t run properly, or at all. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of mods while preventing mishaps:
The great news is that mods aren’t complicated to install, but you still need to pay attention to some detail to get the most out of them. The process is slightly more challenging for mods than custom content (CC), but both follow a similar installation pattern.
We're okay with invites to other servers, but please make sure they're relevant and don't spam them. For example, it's okay to link to a modding server if a modder is looking for a community to join, but it's not okay to spam that link over and over again.
For other mods, most creators announce updates on their websites or social media accounts. In some cases, you can also revisit the mod page to see if the creator has released an updated version. It can be especially troublesome, though, if you can’t recall where you originally found a mod.
To join the server, click on the following link: https://discord.me/thesimswiki. This will open Discord in a separate tab, or open your Discord client. You will be added to the Welcome channel on the server, but you will be free to view and talk in most public channels on the server.
