Thankfully, that is where the solid modding community helps support Sims 4 with gameplay tweaks, new customization options, and, of course, plenty of new jobs that help you further customize the lives of your Sims. There are a ton of options available, so here are my favorite job mods out there that you should check out.
We have to start with this real estate custom career mod. A real estate career is one of the most popular careers in Sims 4. With this career, players can learn about how to buy and sell houses. They also get to earn lots of money. Itâ€™s not easy though! They have to make sure that their reputation is high and that they meet the different needs of their clients if they want to succeed in this business.
The careers available in The Sims 4 base game are fine to begin with, but once youâ€™ve been playing for a while, they are less than extensive. If you have been finding the career options a little boring, these mods are perfect for you! Here are my top 15 favorite career mods to add some variation into your game.
And one last thing, (I know this intro is getting longðŸ˜…) if you want to make the base game sims 4 active careers more fun, I highly recommend downloading the Get to Work Aspirations Mod which you can find linked in my 36+ Sims 4 Custom Aspirations post (itâ€™s #32 on the list!)

With most things in The Sims 4 universe, you can fix this with the use of career or job mods that can be downloaded from various creators in the community. These jobs cover all sorts of ways of life including things like cosmetology, nursing, and social services and these can really help you create more interesting characters.
Below you are going to find over 40 downloadable custom careers that you can add to your game to give to your sims. These are all rabbit hole careers so they are going to function similarly to careers like business or athletic that are already in the game.
A new mod has been created for the game The Sims 4 that will allow your sim to have their own Youtube channel. Your sim can upload videos of themselves playing games, DIY or makeup tutorials, and more. They can also update their channel with blog posts, vlogs, and live streams to keep up their gamer, DIY, or MUA cred on top of having a full-time job. Another cool thing about this mod is that it will let your sim go vlogging and make videos of their everyday life. To take your Sim down this career path, know that they will struggle. So, you need to have some patience. Check it out on this page.
The Sims 4 offer a lot of opportunities for careers, professions, and ambitions. There are many mods that allow The Sims 4 players to experience new careers or professions in the game, but some of them are better than others. In this article, I give a list of some of the best CC packs for Sims 4 job and career mods. Enjoy!

## Start a new career in the sims 4 modding community.

Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
Go to your Mods folder and right-click it. Again, copy it to your Desktop. Once you're sure you have a copy of your Mods folder on your Desktop, go ahead and delete the copy in your Sims 4 folder. Restart your game and play it for a few minutes. If your game runs without crashing or having errors, you know the issue is with one of your Mods. If it doesn't, you'll need to go out and repair your game (and the issue is something within your Sims 4 game itself).
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
Identifying the problematic mod can be as easy as deleting the last mod you've downloaded, if the problem cropped up after that. Paste your Mods folder back into your Sims 4 folder and then sort your files by Date Modified. Delete the most recent mod/CC and restart your game, play for a few minutes and see if your game works. If so, you've found the problem mod.
While you're online, go into Origin and repair your game. You can do this by clicking on The Sims 4 in your library, selecting the Settings button, and then clicking on Repair Game (please note that you must not be playing the game when you select this option). The game will then repair itself and basically do a fresh install of the files needed to run The Sims 4. It won't damage your save game, and this has actually fixed broken CC (particularly issues with script mods) for me in the past.
Remember that game mods and custom content are designed to work with genuine versions of The Sims 4. There is no guarantee that they will work with pirated versions of the game, so if you do have a pirated version and a mod isn't working, that could be why. The only way to fix this would be to buy a copy of The Sims 4 directly from Origin, where you can ensure the game will be patched regularly and compatible with all mods and custom content.
That's the basics on how to install mods and custom content for The Sims 4, as well as how to troubleshoot, uninstall and keep your Mods folder organised! Got any questions or suggestions that I haven't covered above? Feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to help!
Check that the mod itself is up-to-date. With the Sims 4, nearly every time a patch comes out, it breaks a variety of mods. Usually, the mod's creator will be aware of this and will update their website to notify players of this. Check the page you downloaded the mod from and then delete and reinstall the new version, if necessary. Sims websites like SimsVIP also keep a running tab of incompatible mods and CC after patches.
