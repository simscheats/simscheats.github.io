## Create a custom baby in sims 4 with a range of mods.

If you’re not on console (unfortunately, custom content is not yet available for console Sims 4 players), and you have enough storage, Sims 4 baby cc can add more customization, both from an aesthetic perspective, and even more, interactions to upgrade babies more to feeling like actual sims– whether or not the team chooses to update them.

If you don’t download anything else, I highly recommend this as the best baby mod for Sims 4. This mod goes above and beyond another baby cc, in that it really does add realism and gameplay for sims taking care of a baby. As a family player, I like how it makes Sims 4 babies more interactive. Do note that you cannot use this mod with any mod that alters the base game bassinets– but it is base game compatible. I will note that the bulk of this mod is related to being a parent.
Creating a Sim and building/buying custom content all adds aesthetically pleasing updates to your game, but in the case of baby cc, it really does help address the lack of personalization for Sims 4 babies. While it’s only surface-level additions, I like cc for nurseries and even onesies to make the stories I want to.
The good news is that there are some great pieces of custom content that can really improve babies in Sims 4. Individual content creator’s Patreon pages (most custom content goes for a free, public release a few weeks after debut), The Sims Resource, Mod the Sims, and occasionally, other outlets, such as Pinterest and Tumblr, can link you to some interesting custom content for babies.
This is perhaps my favorite nursery for Sims 4 babies if I had to pick just one. Not only have I used it in my own build before, but it’s simply charming and unique– while still feeling not out of place for a variety of styles. Items come in green, orange, pink, and blue variants. The 11 piece set includes a crib, bumper, baby blanket, canopy, baby mobile, zebra pillow, nursing chair, leg rest, throw blanket, dresser, and changing pad. Download Here.

This option came with the Sims 4 gender update, which expanded the customization option for gender expression. With this update, you can enter create a sim and select whether or not that sim can become pregnant, regardless of if they have a feminine or masculine frame. Simply into CAS mode either directly or by using a dresser or mirror and opting for the “Change Sim” interaction.
The same talented creator delivers another one of my favorite Sims 4 nursery sets, though this set will likely appeal to fans of more realistic, alpha cc. The clean style is modern while still feeling cozy, featuring 10 objects: a decorative crib, pennants, a dresser with three swatches, a toy horse, posters, a toy basket, and a paper box. I especially love the animal posters and the Scandinavian style. Download Here.
Everybody knows that babies need a lot of comforts, so you better be ready to give them! This maxis Match sims 4 baby mod is a collection of baby clothes that go super well with all babies’ sizes. There are variants for both males and females, so you’re all covered.
For a simple combination of the essentials, the Pregnancy Mega Mod by scumbobo and java7nerd is an ideal pick for those who just want to have a bit more control over their offspring and increase the amount of storytelling that's available. This pregnancy mod for The Sims 4 is a combination of a few different ones and lets the player see how many babies a Sim will have, as well as their genders.

## Create a baby with a specific mod.

This mod will give you lots of new things to do together with your baby. Now you can read a bedtime story to your baby, sing a lullaby or play outside – whatever is your wish, this extension has it! It’s filled with new baby interactions that are realistic and fun.
The mod also allows to speed up the pregnancy process by initiating labor instantly or by determining a specific stage of pregnancy. Moreover, it lets the player terminate a pregnancy. This is a great all-rounder mod and simple enough if the player just wants a bit more control over things.
What's cool about this mod is that it also works for any pets in the household who might be pregnant and who suddenly go into labor. An option even exists to spawn a new puddle with each contraction that a pregnant Sim experiences, to make it even more realistic.
Tired of your baby being confined to their crib? This mod by Kiolometro allows your baby just a little more freedom, if only in appearance. Essentially, it replaces the default bassinet and frees a Sims 4 baby to be placed on any flat surface. A favorite way to use this mod is to pair it with custom content cribs and beds– which is why it can actually be incredibly useful. Say goodbye to blah base game bassinet and free your baby up to a more unique and personalized option. Download Here.
The Cribs and No Cribs mod allows you to switch the basic crib that is in the base game to a crib (and changing table) you can download separately. An invisible crib comes with the mod, which needs to be placed before having the baby. After placing the baby there you can move them (just like any other movable object) into the downloaded crib or anywhere else.
This simple mod allows your baby’s needs to decay more slowly, leaving you time for other sims in the household, and/or other tasks. The need for decay is halved, meaning that you’ll only have to tend to your baby’s needs every other day. There’s even an option for a no needs decay–if you’re really not into taking care of your baby’s hunger and bladder needs.
Once the baby is born it will always belong to the alien life state, with all the special abilities belonging to that occult creature type. There's even an achievement in the Origin version of the game called 'Special Delivery' that specifically requires you to have a male Sim give birth to an alien baby.
Who else hates the limit for creating babies? For those of us who love big families, it’s really important to be able to create as many children as we want! Well, Claudiasharon has done a brilliant job of removing that limit. And with this mod, you can make up to 25 babies.
