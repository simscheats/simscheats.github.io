## Sims 4 game expansion packs

Game Packs can add a lot to your Sims experience but not as much as an Expansion Pack. They cost $20 and include a number of new options for designing/dressing your Sims and house furnishings. Sometimes they even include a new world, though they might be worlds only made for visiting, not permanent living. Game Packs also add skills or mechanics, though they're less game-changing.

REALLY? a sims 4 seasons i didn't like seasons in sims 3 why would i like it in sims 4. They should really put sims 4 pets as an expansion pack. Pets was good in number 3 but they need more than just horses, cats, dogs, cattle, poultry, rodents, reptiles and birds they should really put more pets in that your sim can interact with like i don't know maybe a ferret or a hamster they could add Guinea pig or even pigs. There are all sorts of animals they could put in maybe they could put in a zoo expansion pack where you go to the zoo and interact with the animals like tamed baby panthers and meerkats or koalas and pandas that would be a really good idea.
I love the direction they're taking with the Sims 4 packs. Instead of buying outrageously overpriced items from the Sims Store, you buy a new pack that includes a bunch of new items and gameplay opportunities. Stuff packs now add new gameplay elements unlike the ones from the previous generation. Plus they're only 10 bucks now! New game packs are awesome and priced the same as Sims 3 Stuff Packs! Great value for money!
Expansion Packs are the most feature-rich DLC, and that's why they usually cost $40 a piece. They change how you play. Each expansion adds a new world where your Sims can live, at least one new activity, new objects and venues, new items for your Sims, new household items, and things like new traits, careers, or skills.
My First Pet Stuff: This Pack garnered a lot of flak from the Sims community, largely because people felt like the items should have been included with the Cats and Dogs Expansion Pack. If pets are a big part of your gameplay, you'll probably still like it. (Here's what's included.)

Below, I will go through every piece of DLC in the game. (I've tried them all!) First, I'll give an overview of my favorite $40 Expansion Packs and others I think you can skip. I'll do the same for all the $20 Game Packs available, which add a mix of features and items. And last are the $10 Stuff Packs, which add themed items for your house and Sims. The links for each pack go to PC/Mac redemption codes you can buy and enter into EA's Origin game store.
Snowy Escape: This expansion adds a Kyoto-like world, mixing hot pot and Japanese-inspired vending machines with activities like bathhouses, skiing, and snowboarding. Its best feature is the addition of emotional depth via Sentiments (feelings about other Sims) and Lifestyles (traits your Sim can acquire). If you're bored of the same old gameplay, this pack is great, but it isn't essential.
Updated on July 4th, 2020 by Anastasia Maillot: Fans were given a pretty unique and rare treat with Eco Lifestyle, a pack that hasn't existed in The Sims franchise before. Although the idea was a breath of fresh air, even if some of the expansion has been a bit lackluster gameplay-wise, fundamental issues still continue to plague The Sims 4.
The amount of content is arguably a little on the light side particularly when compared to some of the later packs, but what's in here really stands out and enhances the game in several ways, particularly if socialising is a big part of your Sims' experience.

## Sims 4 add-on expansion packs

Instead, I want to help you out by giving you a few great mods you can download and install today for free. These are larger mods and can be considered as replacements to The Sims 4 expansion packs. They have tons of content, including new gameplay modes that you can’t have even if you own all the DLCs in Sims 4.
Many simmers don’t like the general idea of paid expansion packs. I mean, we wouldn’t have any problem if The Sims 4 came out as a full game with all the necessary things such as seasons, pets, multiple worlds, clubs, bars, and so on. In fact, many consider The Sims 4 base game to be an “empty game.” And because free expansion packs are still not a thing, we must turn our attention to other solutions, such as free mods and CC.
See, The Sims 4 is awesome, but there's a catch. The base game is sometimes as cheap as $5, and $40 at most. But that’s before the add-ons. With nine Expansion Packs, eight Game Packs, and 17 Stuff Packs available, it can cost you as much as $700 to get all the extra things. That's as much as a brand-new iPhone, a laptop, or the beginnings of a great savings account. It's all pretty tempting, but you don't need all that downloadable content (DLC) for The Sims 4.
Star Wars: Journey to Batuu: This is my least-favorite Sims 4 add-on. It adds a vacation world and a bunch of Star Wars shenanigans, like the ability to own a lightsaber or droid, or interact with Kylo Ren. The Build/Buy items are okay, but I find the gameplay is lacking. If you're a die-hard Star Wars fan, you might like it, but for myself (and many others), this feels like a cash grab. Your Sims can't even use The Force! (Here's what's included.)
The Sims 4 offers a solid base game with plenty to do, but we all know the best gameplay is ahead when the number of Expansion and other DLC increase the amount of features, and seeing those come together to give us all more to do in the game. Currently, The Sims 4 is on track to compete with The Sims 3's Expansions and Stuff Packs in price and value. We have two categories of addons for TS4 that add actual gameplay: full-blown Expansions and smaller, cheaper Game Packs.
As The Sims4 continues to get major content updates from EA in an official capacity, a huge number of fan-created mods have been added. Some of these modders' creations rival those major expansions - both for quality and quantity of additions. Here are a few that stand out.
Admin: I am not in-the-know or involved in development in any way but have a strong suspicion that both of those things will happen down the line. The next Expansion does seem like it might help Sims to have more reason to get out of the house (Get Together) and I'm personally excited for it. I've just added this one to the list. The game does get better.. but as always with the franchise, have to have the expansions to get all those features.
Installing DLCEA Origin can sometimes be unintuitive. It's a good platform for downloading games, but the method for installing new GP/EP offerings is a little too... minimal, compared to the past. Each Sims 3 Expansion is listed individually, but Sims 4 DLC is listed under 'more info' (the i you see when clicking The Sims 4). Installing them is easy once you know how to access the list. You'll note that your time played is likely only counting time from when you launched the game from Origin. There's no way I've played only 18 hours.
