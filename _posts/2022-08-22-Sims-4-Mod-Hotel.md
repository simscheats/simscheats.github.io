## The sims 4 mod hotel introduces a new type of game content: mods.

The official name of the mod I’m talking about here is Resorts & Hotels Mod. This Sims 4 hotel mod is done entirely by kawaiistacie, whom I often feature here on SnootySims. I dare say she is the best creator when it comes to new, interesting, and realistic mods for the game, so definitely check more of her creations.

One thing that players of The Sims 4 are always asking for is a resort and hotel system in the game, and somehow modders have been able to make that happen. The resorts/hotels mod by Kawaii Stacie (Patreon) allows you to run or visit a hotel which is insanely cool for a mod.
Mods for the sims 4 include things like attending school with your children, having tragedies happen to your sims, and so much more. Below are 100+ mods that you can download for The Sims 4 that will change the game and are all really great options if you need to mix it up.
Have you ever wanted Hotels in The Sims 4? Well now you can! With my Hotel Mod, your sims can finally move into their own hotel! This mod adds a new Hotel venue, which sims can live on. It also invites 6 sims to act as the guests of the hotel. There is also one sim which takes care of cleaning the hotel. I strongly advise you to download Scumbumbo’s door locking mod so the hotel’s guests don’t constantly barge into your room.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.

The Sims 4 has always been a great game for those of us who enjoy simulating the real world and giving it an alternate touch. And by this, I mean everything that the real world can offer – from building amazing homes to creating new and interesting family members. And while the idea of travel isn’t new to TS4, we’ve never really been able to visit and stay in hotels. But that’s all about to change thanks to the Sims 4 hotel mod!
Mods are an excellent way to customize your Sims’ lives further and bring new challenges and items into the game. You’ll usually have more problems finding the content you like and installing it into the game. That’s a part of Sims 4’s charm. With so many community members, new custom content is available frequently.
These sims 4 mods have all been in my game at some point and have all brought me immense amounts of joy in the game. I absolutely love adding sims 4 mods because the game can get stale if you playa every single day for years and years. Hopefully you enjoyed this list of mods and it can inspire you to play something more exciting!
Mods are really an amazing way to change up The Sims 4 and make your game more interesting and unique, and the slice of life mod is honestly one of my must have mods in the game. It makes it feel so much more real and makes me want to play more often because the sims are so unique and individual. I would suggest this mod for anyone who is looking into mods for the first time and it’s awesome.

## Mods let you control the minutiae of your sim's life, from their clothes to their moods to their love life.

Many Sims 4 players enjoy how the game looks and works as-is. However, members of the online Sims community have spent countless hours developing content to enrich and enhance the game and bring it to new heights. Mods allow you to get new features out of a game and change how some old functions work.
Speaking of the Slice of Life features, the mod impacts the emotional mechanics of the game by adding new content like memories, social life, personality, and more. Apart from this, you can also throw & get invited to parties, allow sims to text, watch streams, watch movies and get drunk from drinking alcoholic beverages.
Sometimes when I see a mod, I think wow, why is this not already a thing? There are a few interactions you’ll see pop up when a sim is in a certain emotional state but honestly there just aren’t enough. This mod adds a few new emotional socials for your sim to partake in that make a lot of sense.
Sometimes when you are creating sims it can be hard to choose a direction to take them, and the life decider mod helps a ton with that. If you choose to have the mod decide your sim’s life it will choose some random skills, career, friends, and much more allowing you to possibly experience some new gameplay.
Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.
The have some personality please mod, created by Polarbearsims (patreon)gives your sims a bit better personality, involving things like no idle chat, and more things learned from deep conversations. You can also use this mod for things like risky woohoo and giving your sim extra autonomy.
This mod also adds a body image system where your sims will get different moods based on how they are feeling about their bodies. You can boost your own confidence using a mirror, or even compliment other people to give them more confidence and make them happy.
With the mod installed, you'll see a lot more options and choices at every stage of the child-rearing process in The Sims 4. For example, when you're talking about your Sim's infant, you'll have a lot more conversational topics to choose from. And when you interact with the bassinette, your options there will be enhanced as well.
by LittleMsSam does many, many small mods that fix problems or improve things based on her own annoyances with the game. Let friends age up is a good example of this - it will make your Sims' friends age up all at once, which makes sense... and is also a matter of convenience. She has a lot of things to browse so I suggest you use her mods list and look around. There are many standalone mods, but also random small mods. You can also download all of her random small mods in one package and look through files to see what you'd like to keep or toss.

## Mods can be downloaded and installed directly into your game, without ever leaving the mod hotel.

The great news is that mods aren’t complicated to install, but you still need to pay attention to some detail to get the most out of them. The process is slightly more challenging for mods than custom content (CC), but both follow a similar installation pattern.
Installing the mods is somewhat of a misnomer, as you don’t need to follow an installation process. Once you have downloaded the mod files and opened them with an unzipping program, the steps will differ based on the types of mod you’re downloading. There are four main categories:
Once you start downloading mods, you may not want to stop. However, you should note that some mods don’t play well with other ones. In severe cases, the game won’t run properly, or at all. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of mods while preventing mishaps:
Whether you’re using Steam or Origin to play the game, the process for downloading the mods doesn’t change. Since Steam hasn’t enabled the Workshop for Origin games, you can’t keep a list of mods directly on the platform and have to download each mod manually.
If it weren't for the fact that cheats are meant to be somewhat secret and naughty (they do stop you from earning achievements, for example), we'd recommend this mod to everyone. If you're already using cheats on PC or Mac, you really should get it and save yourself some effort as you bend the game to your will.
To download this mod you are going to want to go head over to Kawaii Stacie’s Websitewhere you’ll see all of the features of this mod explained by the creator and if you scroll down there will be an instal link down toward the bottom of the page for both PC and Mac users. There is also detailed guides to show you how to install it properly.
The application usually installs everything automatically and gives you the instructions to complete the installation process. Advanced modders use application files to make more complex content that works with different file types and add more functionalities, but these tend to be rare.
Sometimes, a mod doesn't have to be complicated to make a big difference to your game. By simply adding two new traits to the game, this mod from Vitorpiresa grants the player access to a brace of important abilities that many would find... unnatural.
