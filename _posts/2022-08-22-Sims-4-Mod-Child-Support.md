## Mod child support allows you to add child support to existing sims 4 games.

NOTE 4: Custody availability: available to married sims, Significant Others, and any Sim separating through my system, directly under the normal menus. For other cases (parents with no relationship, etc), so long as they had a child together after this mod was installed, they should have the options under ‘Actions’ instead of under the normal menus.

So this has nothing to do with the Parenthood game pack but since this post is pretty much about parents and parenting, I thought I’d throw this one in there too. So MC Command Center has this really cool feature that allows parents of child sims to collect child support from the non-custodial parent (parent the child does not live with). It happens automatically and applies to all households in the world where there are children living with only one parent.
If you miss the private school system from The Sims 2, this collection of Mods by KawaiiStacie are a dream come true to your family-guided gameplay! Entertain your viewers with a whole new set of interactions made to increase the student experience of your Sims. This mod includes four education-themed modules that suit toddler, child and teen sims:
You can personalize nearly everything in your Sims worlds with this mod, from population diversity to alien abductions, with a highlight spot to the NPC Control module, which allows you to control Sims outside your household. Cool cheat commands are also added to the game, making it possible to force promotions and demotions, change skill levels and prompt abductions.
The Sims 4 offers amazing worlds, state-of-the-art building tools, and endless stories you can create as you play. However, that doesn’t mean the game is not lacking in realism and customization. Fortunately, Custom Content creators came up with solutions to almost every problem the game might present, and you can access it all for free!

The mod includes 16 new personality types, as well as new emotions such as humiliated, furious, or depressed. Your Sims can become social influencers, be sponsored by brands, and take care of their skin and body through new phone interactions. Note: all mod functionalities can be enabled and disabled as you desire!
While your Sim’s child is staying with their other parent, they may be contacted by the other parent with various situations regarding their kids. They could be phone calls just giving them updates and information about their child or your Sim may have to make some kind of decision. Some example situations Lumpinou describes on the website are the other parent calling them about a school trip for their child and wanting to know if your Sim can pitch in to cover the field trip cost. There is also a situation in which the other parent may have to stay late at work and wants to know if your Sim can take the kids for them that day.
Children taken away by social services can now be adopted by NPC families, maximum household sizes can be changed, skill difficulty and motive decay can be increased or decreased, and new Sims can be randomly aged, so not every new Sim starts at 0 days old in their lifespan.
SNBank: this mod was designed to provide you better handle on your Sims financials, adding many realistic features to the game. Combining the features from this mod with Rags-to-Riches style gameplay can be so much fun: your Sims can now have individual bank accounts and choose how much of their pay goes to the household funding. They can make transfers, save or withdraw their money from their phones or in a bank lot (now added to the game). A more refined home service and bills system are also added to the game, along with different benefits, such as alimony or child support.

## Mod child support is a great way to debug mods.

"All users must be able to access the mods in full for free regardless of whether they donate," the update stated. "Mods must be non-commercial and distributed free-of-charge. Mods cannot be sold, licensed, or rented for a fee, nor can mods contain features that would support monetary transactions of any time."
This mod makes the bulletin board that comes with the pack useful for more than just obsessively hanging drawings and leaving notes by adding cleaning schedules for members of your sims’ household. Great for teaching your sim kids responsibility or large households which are notorious for staying dirty.
Feel like it’s way too easy to raise well-mannered, empathetic, responsible kids? Well this mod makes it a lot easier to fall into the threshold for negative character value traits and ultimately makes you and the sim parent work a little harder to raise good kids.
The Mods on this list are well crafted, tested and functional selections, which you can mix and match according to what you want in your game. However, if you want something more specific, there are thousands of Mods available for download, for free, just a few clicks away! When you’re browsing for Mods, keep a few things in mind:
Consider supporting your favorite modders or giving them shoutouts when streaming or filming content with their content. Modders that produce high-quality content often have Patreon or ko-fi accounts, so you can help fund their projects with any amount you can!
Ever feel like the kids and toddlers in game are constantly making messes? Like they just break out of whatever interaction they were performing just to go make a random mess? Or worse, to clean up the mess they just made for absolutely no reason at all? Well this mod helps with that by changing the autonomy of the “Make a Mess” and “Clean Up Mess” interactions making them occur less often. With this mod installed, the likelihood of messes being made or cleaned up will also be influenced by trait, mood and character value level.
Child Support is calculated with a fixed price of §550 + 5% of the non-Custodial Parent's Household and SNB Accounts + 25% of any Career Pay. This set up makes sure that the paying parent isn't skimping out on sending support in any shape or form. All of these defaulted values are customizable in the Bills Settings except for the Household Wealth.
If you’re looking for a less robust mod to improve playability, Cheat Shortcuts by Plastic Box is a safe choice. Have you been caught typing cheats over and over again before getting them right on the cheat tab? This simple and discrete mod provides you with the ability to find all major cheats quickly and easily, saving you time and embarrassment during your Streams.
