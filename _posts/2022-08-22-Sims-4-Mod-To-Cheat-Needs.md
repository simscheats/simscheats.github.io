Do you miss the old conveniences of being able to click to cheat needs in past sims games? Well, UI Cheats Extension will give you back that option as well as so many other places to click to make your game completely cheatable. If you’re looking to a super straightforward and easy to use cheat mod for the game than this one is for you.
If you want to fast-pace the progress of your game and make it a lot easier, this Sims 4 UI cheats extension mod is indeed a perfect choice for you. The entire Sims 4 community considers it as a necessary tool that offers several features to make the game more interesting for you.
You absolutely NEED this mod if you are a player that cheats your sim’s needs a lot. To explain what this mod does in simplest terms, instead of having to type cheats codes into the cheats bar, you can visually click on things in the sims 4 UI (such as skills, needs, money, etc.) to alter them.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.

## Mod to cheat in life sims.

The first mod on our list is MC Command Center and it has been around for years and lets you cheat so many things in the game, with some of my favorites being the pregnancy cheats. To use MC Command Center you can click on sims, or the mailbox and there will be a new box to click that says MC Command Center and when you click this you’ll be given tons of options.
These mods weren’t entirely made to help you cheat the game. Sometimes bugs just happen and they won’t resolve on their own. I mean, that’s why the Reset Sim cheat exists right? That’s why modders have created them. So that they can solve complex issues in a simple way!
The UI Cheats Extension mod is a tool that gives you the final judgment of almost everything in your game. Whether you need some money or you want to control the needs of your Sims, you can do so through this mod! You won’t need to type or insert cheat commands in any place. Instead, everything works with a simple click-and-drag technique which we will explain further!
In case you are trying to follow a particular storyline, you can use this mod to make your Sims feel angry or sad as per the skit. Furthermore, as the game is completely unpredictable and nobody knows what happens next, this tool can prove to be exceptionally helpful.
This one is super handy if you add random NPC Sims to your world. Without the Life Decider mod by KawaiiStacie (opens in new tab), NPC Sims will have no career, no income, and zero skills. If you don't want to manually stir every Sim towards a certain career or don't want to fill out their skillset, this mod will do it for you. It comes with a bunch of interesting bonus traits too, such as a sweet tooth, a drinking problem, or bad cooking skills.
There are also lots of automatic settings geared towards letting non-controlled Sims live full lives without you, getting married and having babies of their own volition, and you can also use the mod to adjust the in-game time settings so your Sims don’t take half a day to shower and have breakfast. If you only grab one mod, make it this one.
When the Tiny Living stuff pack came out, fold-down Murphy beds seemed like a treat. That is until everyone realized that they seem to kill your Sims quite often. This mod may seem simple but it can save you from a real headache. No more Murphy bed deaths and cheating your Sims back to life after!
Along the same lines as the last mod listed, the always move objects on mod will enable the best cheat code in the game at all times. The move objects cheat allows you to place any objects without the grid stopping you from being able to place things close together. It also allows for alt placing of objects so you can place things in whatever direction you want. This mod by Twisted Mexi will go ahead and make it so this cheat is always on which is so useful if you’re a frequent builder.
