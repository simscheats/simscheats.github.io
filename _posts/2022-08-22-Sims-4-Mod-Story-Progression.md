## The sims 4 mod story progression tutorial explains how to make a mod that progresses through a story.

Unfortunately, unlike the Sims 3, there is no way to just “turn on” story progression. You’ll have to do everything manually through this mod. It usually bypasses your household sims, unless you stumble upon a bug or a glitch. So, you’ll have to set everything the way that you want to. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing!

The Sims 4 story progression mod is a part of the sims 4 master controller that allows for normal progression of the game making it believable and close to real-life scenarios. It includes elements such as pregnancy, Risky Woohoo (explicit mods), making enemies, having children, getting married, get promotions, and so on.
Let’s face it, story progression is fun in Sims games. In Sims 3, we had nRaas and their mods but that is not the case on Sims 4. Now, NPC sims are boring, with no depth at all. Well, at least until now! Today, we looked all over the place to bring you a story progression mod for the Sims 4. And we have found it! Its name is Master Controller Command Center and it resembles nRaas’s Master Controller! Let’s look over how this mod can help you add story progression to your game.
YOU MADE IT! Seriously, if you managed to make it this far, I commend you. MCCC is a BEAST of a mod, and I didn't even touch on all of it. Take your time exploring it and reading the descriptions for each setting if you're curious about what else you can do! The Sims 4 world is yours to mold and change as you see fit with MCCC.
In order to simulate story progression, you’ll have to do it manually. Just click on a random sim’s portrait and enter the menu. Then, you can mark them for marriage or pregnancy. So, they will have a random chance that they’ll do that every week. Unless you unmark them once you see that their life has drastically changed. Sims need a break as well after all!
