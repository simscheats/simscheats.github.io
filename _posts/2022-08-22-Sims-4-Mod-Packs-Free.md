## Sims 4 mod packs are available for free.

Instead, I want to help you out by giving you a few great mods you can download and install today for free. These are larger mods and can be considered as replacements to The Sims 4 expansion packs. They have tons of content, including new gameplay modes that you can’t have even if you own all the DLCs in Sims 4.

The list of possible Sims 4 mods is basically endless. You can spend hours and hours looking through various websites, trying to find out whether a given mod is useful or just a waste of time. Over dozens of hours, we’ve tested a plethora of mods and hand-picked the ones most worthy of your attention. Through some trial and error, we’ve also listed which mods contradict each other and won’t function if both are installed at the same time.
Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
Thanks for checking out our guide to the best Sims 4 CC creators and packs. If you’re looking for more Sims 4 goodness, check out the best Sims 4 mods for something a little more fleshed out. If you’re looking for something more risqué, there are some Sims 4 sex mods you can check out too.
That’s everything you need to know about Sims 4 custom content. If you’re looking for general Sims 4 mods, we’ve got an excellent guide for that. We’ve also got a Sims 4 cheats list if you’re looking for some help running your sim’s lives. Failing that, why not read up on what we want from The Sims 5, should Maxis decide to give us another iteration.

Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.
If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)
If you’re into fantasy gameplay, then Become a Sorcerer is a mod for you. Of course, The Sims 4 has its official Realm of Magic DLC that deals with the same topic. However, Become a Sorcerer is the perfect replacement if you don’t want to spend any money!

Game Packs can add a lot to your Sims experience but not as much as an Expansion Pack. They cost $20 and include a number of new options for designing/dressing your Sims and house furnishings. Sometimes they even include a new world, though they might be worlds only made for visiting, not permanent living. Game Packs also add skills or mechanics, though they're less game-changing.
