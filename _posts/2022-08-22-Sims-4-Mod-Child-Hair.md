Alongside the expansion, a couple of interesting changes will be introduced to the The Sims 4 base game for free, ones the community has long been asking for. First, your Sims no longer need to look like smooth plastic action figures—body hair is coming to the game at long last, including chest and stomach hair, arm and leg hair, new facial hair options, and yes, even back hair.
When you’re looking for amazing custom content hair for your sim’s it’s important to look for different hairs depending on the age your sims are at the time. You want hair that is specific for toddlers in the game because toddlers deserve to look like toddlers. Happy Playing!
Sims 4 has a wide range of hair options but when it comes to hairstyles for kids, there are less choices. Luckily, there is an ever-growing market for Sims 4 male custom content. There are literally thousands of options and it can be a bit overwhelming to find the best one for your child. Let alone that children can be very difficult to dress for. They are often embarrassed about their hair, so it is important to experiment with different hairstyles on them. With the introduction of custom content, you can now create unlimited styles for your children.
This furry new feature isn't just a decoration you choose in the character creation menu—you'll be able to toggle an option for growable hair, meaning your Sim will go from a five-o-clock shadow to a beard and body hair will slowly grow over time. Naturally, shaving will become an option so you can keep your Sim neatly groomed as part of your hygiene routine, if that's your thing. It should be noted that while this is being added to the base game, players who purchase the High School Years expansion will have more body and facial hair options than are included in this free update.

There is a visual glitch with the new hair from 4/13 Sims Delivery Express update. It's floating off the head of child aged Sims. When I zoom in closer, to jumps back on the Sim's head. Please see attached screenshot for the visual glitch I am experiencing. So far it has not happened with teen/adult aged Sims.
After all, they have hair just like any Sim, and they need something to do with it. Hugo Hair is a simple boy’s haircut that leaves them with a little length to play around with, and it’s not dull and lifeless like a lot of the base game options tend to be.
Have you ever played The Sims 4 and wished your kid looked like late David Bowie? Here it is then, the ideal haircut for your rising star! This mod will give your Sim a super sharp look and some extra handsomeness when performing fun activities. Big thanks to the creator Mathcope who published it on The Sims Resource.
