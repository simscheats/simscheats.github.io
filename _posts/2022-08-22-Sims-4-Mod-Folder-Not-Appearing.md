## Sims 4 mod folders not appearing

@LottieGrayYT That's not the Sims 4 folder where you need to add mods. As the original instructions say, the correct folder is in Documents\Electronic Arts. Be sure to start your game at least once, so that this Sims 4 folder will be created.And please remove the Mods folder you created from the Sims 4 folder in Program files (x86). That data doesn't belong there and can only cause problems.

I have a problem too with my mods folder. Yesterday I bought the sims 4 base game with the cats and dogs expansion pack , the location of mine sims 4 folder is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games and when i open it , it didnt have mods folder i made one and then i put my mods and cc the cc and mods that i have inside dont show up in my game and i have inside the mods folder the resource.cfg file but still they dont show up in my game . What can I do ? Do I need to buy all the packs ?
Hi @simmercutie1,Creating the folder is not enough as you need a file resource.cfg inside your folder for mods to work.If it's missing, the Mods folder and resource file will be regenerated by the game the next time you open your game. Once the game has created the Mods folder and the resource file inside it, you can install your games as usual.-Mai
Mod files in .zip format: The mod files which you download through the internet are in a zipped format. In order to properly place them in the correct location, you need to unzip them and then place the contents. If this isn’t the case, the mods will fail to work.
As a general rule, always back up your Sims 4 folder to a USB drive or external drive in case of disaster. Right-click your file and then select “Copy” (Ctrl + C on your keyboard), navigate to the safe location you’ve made, and then right-click and select “Paste” (Ctrl + V on your keyboard) into the new location.

I've had issues in the past with my custom content not appearing in the game, and I vaguely remember being told to delete the mods folder on the promise that when I reopen the game another mods folder will appear automatically. I don't think this happened. I now do not have a mods folder, is there any way to get a new mods folder or if creating one manually would work? Not an urgent question, seeing as I'm getting a mac next week, and I'm hoping that when I install the game on the mac all of the folders will automatically install as well. But if you have a solution off the top of your head, let me know!
Bad mods: If there are any corrupt or bad mods in your mods directory, there is a possibility that the entire batch of mods will not work. Here we have to apply a technique where we test each mod one by one to find the culprit and disregard it from the folder.
It’s also very easy to accidentally move a folder on Windows in which case, you could be looking at a folder within a folder. A good test for this is also that if you remove the mods folder completely, the game should automatically create a new one if you start the game. If it doesn’t, a different folder is used.
If all the above methods don’t work, it is possible that your mod list contains a problematic mod that is causing issues. In this solution, we will try to create a new user settings folder in your computer and after copying the major old configurations, test each mod one by one. If there is any problematic mod, we will be able to detect it and remove it. This method will require that you analyze each case very carefully and will cause it to be tedious so make sure you have plenty of time.

Put your mods there.If this doesn't work, do you have onedrive on your computer? ____________________________________________________________________If you find an answer helpful, give your fellow simmers some XP!

@chloherm714Did your folder get deleted or does your mods not show up in game? The file directory is your folder, what exactly are you asking for?Usually you have the mods in C:\Users\Username\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\mods, if you deleted them, check your trash can.If you have the mods in the folder but they're not showing up in game:I guess you double checked that script mods and cc were activated in the game options? Both of them?And then you have mods that do not work? All mods or just some? If it's just some mods that do not work, which ones?If no mods show up in your gameDid you place them in C:\Users\Username\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\ModsDo the game register that there are mods? Do they show up in the list in the beginning or if you open the mods list from the options menu?Do you have OneDrive on your computer? Make sure that the game is not using the OneDrive-folders. Try turning off OneDrive before starting the game.You can check where the game saves your files by looking in your Game Options - Screenshot settings.Make sure that the path above is the same place as where you have your saves and mods.
I've noticed a problem with my sims 4 game: Any of the mods I've downloaded and installed for it won't show up in game. I am certain that I have installed them correctly to the mods folder and mods are enabled in my game so they should show up. But they don't. Any idea what is causing this or how I could fix this?
Like mentioned before, Sims 4 rolled out an update where users were given an option in-game which allowed them to enable/disable the mods. Previously, this wasn’t the case and the game would automatically load all the mods as long as they were in the mods folder. In this solution, we will navigate to the in-game options and make sure that the option is enabled.
So I recently installed the Sims 4 again, and had to re-enable mods after the newest update. Everything was fine, so I went to create a Sim, only to be unable to pick traits or aspirations, which I looked up and found out it was a faulty mod or something like that, and after trying everything I just decided to restart my file. (Which meant backing up my folder before deleting it entirely and then starting the game, which restarted my game entirely). After that, I installed some new mods and kept some of the older ones since I'm pretty sure they weren't the bad ones. Though I've tried everything, none of my mods are showing up in the game, I won't even get the popup in the beginning. I have it checked to allow mods, I've tried restarting my computer, restarting my file, checking for bad mods, deleting them entirely. I've even tried running my first file, and even swapping the new mods with all the old ones, and they won't even pop up then.I had this problem when I first started playing, and was able to fix it, but I don't remember how since that was a few months ago.I don't have any subfolders, and all the mods are .package. I've edited the resource.cfg, even tried deleting it, but nothing is working. Any help?
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
