## Create unique sims careers by taking on active roles in the community.

This job fills up your career panel, and now your sim is self-employed, and you can give him as many tasks as you want or run the business with more official status. This mod was created for role-playing, but we can see a lot of areas you can use it in The Sims 4.

The major point of profession is that players must direct Sims to perform certain tasks. They no longer go to rabbit holes, and instead, players can actually see what Sims do at work. Professions aren't usually tied to a workplace. Sims earn weekly stipend every Sunday. Professional Simoleon Boosterlifetime reward enables Sims to earn more weekly stipend. Additionally, Sims will earn bonuses after finishing their task (such as extinguishing fire, completing a renovation, performing on stages, etc.) or performing for tips[TS3:ST]. Sims can also earn raise if they work hard enough.
Active CareersThe Sims 4 Get to WorkExpansion Pack adds Active Careers to the game: Scientist, Detective, and Doctor. You get the choice whether or not you'll view and control your Sim at work, meaning you can send them to work autonomously like any other Career. When in control, you will have a variety of tasks to complete while on the job. The more of these tasks you complete - from serious ones directly related to the Career, to those like gossiping with co-workers - the higher your performance for the day.
Sims have broader and more flexible ways to earn performance. Professions aren't provided with work performance; Sims will earn job experience instead, based on their completion of responsibilities. Most professions aren't attached to certain skills, though high skills might help Sims with their job.
This is another career by MarlynSims and itâ€™s incredibly detailed! The city living expansion is required. This career is semi-active, meaning your sims can work from home and complete tasks. They receive Â§220 Simoleons per task and will receive 4 tasks per day.

Profession (also known as active career) is an aspect of career which players have to direct Sims to do their work instead of the basic careers where Sims only enter a rabbit hole[TS or off-world[TS and gain performance based on several factors. This feature is first introduced in The Sims 3: Ambitions, and is the main theme of the expansion pack. Further expansion packs also provide more unique professions. Professions are re-introduced with The Sims 4: Get to Work, which includes three new professions. The Sims 4: City Living introduces semi-active careers, where players can choose to have Sims work at home or off-world.
Some of these Careers affect playersâ€™ gameplay, like the Doctor Career, where players have to travel with their Sim to the job location.. However, the others donâ€™t take players to any locations, but the Sim either works from home or, like the Culinary Career , the Sim would disappear for a few hours.. Keep in mind, that not all The Sims 4 Careers branch out like the Doctor Career.. Unlike most of The Sims 4 Careers , Scientist doesnâ€™t branch out once Simmers reach a certain rank.. Like most Careers, The Astronaut Career splits into two branches when Simmers reach rank eight.. Like most of The Sims 4 Careers, the Secret Agent has two branches: Diamond Agent and Villain.. Once players reach the last rank of the first branch, the Sim will work a 15-hour shift three days a week.. The Secret Agent Career is one of the few Careers that has two branches with good pay.. When Simmers reach level 10 in the Investor branch, their Sim will become an Angel Investor and work four days a week for eight hours.. Surprisingly, the Stylist branch of the Style Influencer Career pays a lot more than the Trend Setter branch.
We have to start with this real estate custom career mod. A real estate career is one of the most popular careers in Sims 4. With this career, players can learn about how to buy and sell houses. They also get to earn lots of money. Itâ€™s not easy though! They have to make sure that their reputation is high and that they meet the different needs of their clients if they want to succeed in this business.
When itâ€™s time for the gig, you can choose to send your Sim alone or join them on set. Itâ€™s more fun to join your Sim on set. When your Sim arrives on set, theyâ€™ll have a set of goals to complete in the upper left corner of the screen, just like other active careers weâ€™ve seen in the past. Unlike the other active careers, itâ€™s important for your Sim to complete all other goals before they begin filming the production. Once filming has started, all other goals disappear. If you didnâ€™t complete them before, you may not be able to finish the gig at gold level.

Iâ€™m pretty sure youâ€™re not the only one wishing for more career options for your Sims. Sure, there are a lot of careers included in the base game, but this mod has more options that have been missed by the developers.

The Sims 4 has given a new dimension to its gameplay. The introduction of the career mod has not only enabled players to pursue their desired careers and live their dreams but also make the gameplay more realistic. Inspired by real-life comedians, the comedian career mod allows players to make their sims the next big thing in comedy. Whether they want to be a professional comedian, famous social media influencer, or amateur street performer, it is up to them. It is often assumed that being a comedian is one of the hardest jobs out there because they need confidence, wit, and comedy skills on top of being talented at making people laugh. Jokes will be told at random when your sim is using the microphone in any venue. Feel free to download this one from this page.
