## Create custom sims 4 mods with mod packs.

Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.

About Mods and Custom ContentMods and Custom Content are wildly popular among Sims 4 players, but if you're new to the franchise you may be unaware what treasures await those who ravenously scour the web for the latest downloads. There is far more free content available to download than is included in the base game and all game/stuff packs combined. In this guide, I'll teach you how to install CC and mods, explain what they are and offer some direction on where to go from here by providing links to sites where you can binge-download CC for your game.
Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
To help you navigate what's on offer, here’s a lineup of the best Sims 4 mods, from the little tweaks, to the digital life-changers. Make sure to read the installation section, and double check for any conflicts to make sure you’re not running two that will butt heads.
If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)

The Mods FolderNext, find or create the Mods folder. It should already be there, but if it's not you can right click in the white area within The Sims 4 folder and create a folder, being sure to name it Mods. The game automatically recognizes and attempts to utilize anything in this folder. So, once we download CC, we'll copy the files to that folder. Tip: You can have other folders inside the Mods folder, so if you'd like to separate out your CC and Mods in to separate folders, or even categorize them by object/clothing type, you can do so! Additionally, Forum member RandyH notes that it's possible to rename mods so long as you keep the .package at the end of the file name. This can make your organization even simpler, and possibly help you track things down easier. All of this is actually a good idea should you run into a mod or piece of CC that gives you trouble, so that it's easier to find and remove.
Thanks for checking out our guide to the best Sims 4 CC creators and packs. If you’re looking for more Sims 4 goodness, check out the best Sims 4 mods for something a little more fleshed out. If you’re looking for something more risqué, there are some Sims 4 sex mods you can check out too.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.

## Create and share sims 4 mods with others.

Always one step ahead, the Sims community has already created a serious mod to bring multiplayer to The Sims 4. The Sims 4 Multiplayer mod is designed to let you play with other people in real-time on a local network. The mod basically uses one PC as a server, which allows two players to join the same game. It's still in closed beta, but the developer has a Patreon (opens in new tab) to support the project and hopes to expand the mod to allow more than two players in the future.
This handy mod by Weerbesu makes using Sims 4 cheats a breeze if you don't know the lot by heart. Right-clicking various parts of the normal Sims 4 interface will give you extra options for things like giving a household more money, promoting Sims in their careers, or changing the in-game time. You can find the full list of features by scrolling down a bit on the download page.
“The Sims 4: How To Ensure a Healthy Game” by SrslySims: This article is a must read for any mod or CC user who has the basics of this article down but is looking for more advanced knowledge on how to further consolidate and organize their mods and CC. SrslySims goes over many things that are not covered in this basic guide for beginners, like merging your package files and removing special characters from file names in order to alleviate strain on performance.
Tumblr - this link leads to content tagged as sims-4-custom-content on tumblr, where many CC makers have an outlet to share their art. This can help you find creators you want to follow. It can be a good place to browse for new content visually, though be careful because you'll need to visit some download sites that can have confusing links. Watch out for ads that say 'download', and look for buttons like 'Skip ad' so that you can get past a full-screen ad that looks like a download page!
The good news is modding your game isn’t as hard as you think. Sims Community is here to help. We’ll be clarifying any technical terms you might come across while looking for mods and CC, dispelling common myths about mods and CC, and walking you through the process of installing and maintaining your mods and CC step-by-step.
The following are sites that are well-known for hosting CC and Mods. I want to say that I'm not responsible for anything you see or that happens as a result of using these sites. I'm putting those we're all most familiar with up top, as they're in general the best places to go to download things for Sims. Many creators have their own blogs, and they're worth following if you like their work. The two big sites up front here host many items though, and should be visited by anyone interested in expanding their game. You can then explore people's tumblr/wordpress blogs and find creators whose work you enjoy, follow them, and enjoy a better Sims game. Some CC creators specialize in hair, others clothing and some make a mix of everything.
Backing up Saved Games, Mods, and CCYou can backup your Mods and CC just as you can Save files, and it's smart to do this in case of disaster. Copy them to another drive or a USB stick and they're safe from hard drive failure. Head to your Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4 folder. Right click each of those three important folders - Saves, Tray, and Mods. Copy them then paste in a new location, where you know to find them. Should you have to reinstall the game or wipe everything, you've got a copy of your Sims families, and kept your collection of CC and Mods. These are precious because it takes time to build up a collection, and losing dozens of downloads can be a major nuisance.
modthesims.info - Definitely my go-to, though I don't use CC heavily. Everything on MTS is totally free, and it's exceptionally well-organized. This makes for an easy browsing experience. They feature so much content that they are almost all you need in order to really beef up your game with CC. Of course, modthesims also has plenty of mods, and many of the best mod makers in The Sims community are members there.
