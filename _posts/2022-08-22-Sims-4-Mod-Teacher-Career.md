## How to become a mod teacher in the sims 4.

After downloading the Discover University Expansion pack, you can choose the Educationist Career in The Sims 4. This career gives you a choice of two branches Professor or Administrative. So, you can administer the school or teach the students. We’ll also teach you how to get a degree in Sims 4.

An obvious place to start is by improving the core skills associated with your chosen degree; however, things are not as straightforward as you might think. There are a lot of skills in The Sims 4, and proficiency in many of them will get your Sim some way closer to being accepted onto a distinguished degree.
The Education Career is new in The Sims 4 Discover University. This career lets you choose between one of two branches - Administrative or Professor. So you either teach students or run the school. Both get a teacher's desk, apple clock and award they can hang on the wall. This career relies heavily on the new Research and Debate skill that came with the Expansion. It's a nice skill focused on learning and convincing others. As a work from home career, Education offers some flexibility in how the job gets done.
Note: If you are not sure what your Sims work from home assignment is or what you need to do you, can head to the Career panel and there will be a section for Work From Home Assignments/Work Assignment. Hover over the required task and it will let you know how to complete it.
Using a computer or laptop will allow your Sims to access the Education Career Sub-menu in the Careers menu. This allows you to write a letter of recommendation and create a lesson plan. You can also Tutor a student online about a variety of subjects including Arts, Communication, Entertainment, Health and Technology. These are unlocked when you first join the Education Career and your Sim can do any of these interactions while they work their way up the career ladder. You will also unlock more interactions the further through the career your Sim gets.

Do service to your community with two new aspirations: Start with one of these aspirations to gain the Human Library reward trait, which will unlock the social interactions at just at level 4. Become a Renowned Teacher and earn the Teacher’s Handbook trait, which allows Sims to start teaching entire classes at just level 2, or become a Knowledge Pixie and earn the Tutor trait, which increases the effect of sharing knowledge through social interactions.
With every career in The Sims 4, you’ll have different unlockable items that are only available if you complete the requirements or through using cheats. There are 3 really cute unlocks that your sim will receive if they make it through the first 5 levels of the education career.
Follow your Sims to school and help them achieve their education. Attend a different subject every day with the teacher NPC, and demonstrate your knowledge through activity goals. Bored? See the Counsellor for a boost of spirit. Want more to do? Elementary students can apply for special opportunities (unlockable aspirations) from the Principal for a chance to earn Emblems and redeem them for reward traits that will help them later in life.
The Sims 4 Go to School Mod Pack was first released on May 2015 and offered a simple event where Child and Teen Sims would go to school and complete goals which would boost their grade. This new version vastly expands the original experience into a whole new mode of gameplay.

## What are the requirements for becoming a mod teacher in sims 4?

Most of the paths have 5 levels. Academia has 7, taking you all the way up to university President. The idea is that your Sim will probably be an Elder by that time, which seems fitting. Also, that’s where the big Simoleons are. Pay levels are more EA than realistic for a teacher. Educators are sadly underpaid. I wanted to give your Sims a break and pay them what Educators DESERVE. Play with life, right? Lastly, during most of the school and Academia levels you earn a ridiculous amount of PTO. Like, a day per day. Rack it up and take summers off like a real teacher (well, except your Sims will get paid, so BONUS!).
I think the education career is one of the most sought after and many players have been waiting for this to be added for months, if not years. This guide is going to tell you everything you need to know about mastering the education career in The Sims 4.

Education is a work from home career, meaning you can choose not to go into work and instead complete a couple tasks. You get paid the same, but performance is gained a bit later. You'll need to use the Teacher's Portfolio you can find in your Sim's inventory to grade papers. If you happen to lose your Teacher's book, you can find one at a bookshelf under 'Homework Books'.
Educators are amazing! I think of facing a room full middle school kids and my knees get weak. Also, there are so many paths and choices you can make in the education field. And all of them are equally important and interesting. I wanted to kind of dig into what kinds of things Educators do (and I kind of miss the Sims having a teacher career). I hope you have a teacher in your game who will enjoy it.
Your Sim just needs to be enrolled at either university studying any degree in order to access these activities, which can be joined by "Searching for Job" on a phone - they're under the After School Activity category, and basically function like a part-time job (but unpaid, of course).
The Administrator Branch focuses mostly on the budgeting side of education. As such, a lot of their work from home tasks will revolve around using the computer to review budget proposals, plan agendas for meetings, and writing recommendation letters. Planning an agenda makes Sims confident, as does Create Lesson Plan, but only for about 3 hours. Creating a lesson plan raises logic, while many of the others raise Research and Debate. I suppose this is nice, as at times when you work from home the very tasks you'll have to do will help keep you moving along in R&D. Here are the career levels and when you unlock various things (mainly at the first and last levels).
After they graduate with a degree, embarking upon any of the associated careers listed above will allow your Sim to enjoy a series of perks, namely: higher pay; easier promotions thanks to increased performance; more vacation days; and a signing bonus (up to one per in-game week if you choose to change careers). If only the real-life graduate job market was this good.
