## Sims 4 mods are created using the mod manager.

Custom content and general mods: These files end in .package. Open the Mod folder the game has created (Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods) and copy all the mod files into the folder. You can create additional subfolders to organize your growing mod collection better.

And if you click on the furthermost tool in the same corner, the one labeled Open The Sims 4 “Mods” folder, you will be directed to the destination of your installed mod. Notice that if a mod isn’t checked/selected in the main list on the Mod Manger, then it won’t be shown in the folder either.
If you ask why, then you’re on the right track to make your life a lot easier. You see, the Mod Manager is a quality of life, fully developed software that helps you organize all The Sims 4 files. If you’ve ever found yourself in the mess of all the additional mods and CC you download for the game, then this is your ticket out of that hell!
Identifying the problematic mod can be as easy as deleting the last mod you've downloaded, if the problem cropped up after that. Paste your Mods folder back into your Sims 4 folder and then sort your files by Date Modified. Delete the most recent mod/CC and restart your game, play for a few minutes and see if your game works. If so, you've found the problem mod.
After you install the program, the main framework that you’ll be using in it is called Manage Mods. If you click on it, an empty page will open up. Since you have just now installed it for the first time, you will need to import all of your mods and CC. That’s easily done through the little plus “+” button at the bottom left corner. But be aware that sometimes the program links to your Sims 4 folder, and if you already have mods and CC loaded to the game, they might appear on the page.

Open up the folder and check the contents inside. Usually, you'll just see files that end with .package. This is the file-type used for Sims 4 mods and custom content. You might see some other file types too. Some creators include images of their CC or .txt ("read me") files. These can be safely discarded. If you see file types ending in .ts4script, .bpi, .blueprint or .trayitem—these are also Sims 4 file types, and I'll tell you how to install those below. Do not delete them!
Of course, this is the hardest and the most troublesome way of doing this for two main reasons. First, it takes a lot of time. And second, you might end up deleting all the mods and CC that you love. And I do NOT recommend this way if you’re a total beginner in Sims 4!
What this means is that, you can load and unload certain mods and CC whenever you like. If you deselect a bunch of various mods, then the next time you start The Sims 4 you won’t find those mods in there! To turn them back on, just exit the game and check them once again. This amazing tool allows for so much freedom when it comes to dictating your gameplay and we recommend using it!
As the name of this mod suggests, it aims to bring The Sims 4 closer to reality. It does this by adding a range of emotions, the ability to get drunk, the chance to get acne, the menstrual cycle, colds and flu, and memories. And that's not everything! You'll wonder how you played the game without this mod.

## Sims 4 mods can be downloaded from the sims 4 mod store.

Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
Unfortunately, Sims 4 doesn’t have mod support for the PS4. Games generally have minimal modding options on consoles, and games that allow you to change the gameplay are a minority. The developer has no current plans to enable custom content on the PS4, so don’t get your hopes up.
The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
The Sims 4 has many unofficial mods and Custom Content that you can install to expand upon or improve gameplay, such as texture mods, new hairstyles and eye colors, custom houses, and more. This page teaches you everything you need to know about How to Install Mods in TS4 and where to find CC on PC and Mac.
Remember that game mods and custom content are designed to work with genuine versions of The Sims 4. There is no guarantee that they will work with pirated versions of the game, so if you do have a pirated version and a mod isn't working, that could be why. The only way to fix this would be to buy a copy of The Sims 4 directly from Origin, where you can ensure the game will be patched regularly and compatible with all mods and custom content.
If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)
