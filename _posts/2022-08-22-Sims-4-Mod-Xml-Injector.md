So you know how when you download a mod, it mentions something along the lines of “will conflict with any mod that does such and such,” or “has no known conflicts,” etc.? And if you accidentally download a conflicting mod it either causes your game to act weird or one of the mods doesn’t work at all? XML Injector, and other scripts, help avoid this problem by “injecting” the changes or new stuff instead of overriding those files.
For example, when a modder wants to add an interaction directly to a sim they would normally have to override a file called object_sim to do so. If every modder did this you would only be able to have one of these types of mods at a time. But thanks to XML Injector, or a mod’s included scripts, you can have multiple mods that add interactions without any conflicts. So when a mod says you need XML Injector to work, they mean you need it because it injects the interactions (or other stuff in the mod) in order to work, same as if the mod already came with a script.
Moreover, you can test the Sims 4 XML injector on mailbox any electronic gadget like a computer telephone clicking on any sim or relative sim to make an interaction. Also, you don’t have to worry because the simple interface will show all the options on your screen. Furthermore, once you are satisfied with Sims 4 XML you can remove the additional file and test interaction will no longer appear.
