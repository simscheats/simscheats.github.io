## Install mods.

Once you have created a mods folder, you then need to download some mods/cc from a creators site and place those items manually into the newly created mods folder - unzipping if needed.Next, in-game you have to allow mods/cc to be used. Options MenuGame OptionsOther - then check 'Enable Custom Content and Mods' and enable 'Script Mods' if you have downloaded any.

Before you start installing mods and CC, you need to locate your Mods folder. This is where you need to place your downloaded content for your game to be able to read and install it—if you put it anywhere else, it won't work. Content that ends in the .package file extension goes here.
Note about Mod HelpDo not bother asking us for help with mod/cc issues. Go to the mod author on a forum/site they frequent or where they host their content. The mod author knows their work and can help you better than us, additionally they may appreciate bug reports!
Check for mod incompatibility: If you’re using several mods, try using only half of them at a time to check if the issues persist. Changing the selection of mods you use at once can show which mod is the culprit. In some cases, the underlying game programming means some mods simply can’t work together at all, and you’ll need to choose which ones to keep.
Check for mod updates: If a mod is not working due to a game update, chances are the creator has made a new version that patches the problem. You’ll need to remove the previous version of the mod and start from scratch with a new one. Deleting the cache is sometimes necessary as well.

Installing the mods is somewhat of a misnomer, as you don’t need to follow an installation process. Once you have downloaded the mod files and opened them with an unzipping program, the steps will differ based on the types of mod you’re downloading. There are four main categories:
Hi, I have a problem, I followed all the steps, but when I download the mods and put them in the folder it still doesn't appear in the game, there is this window telling me about the mods that I downloaded but they still don't appear in the game... Can someone help me?
Once you start downloading mods, you may not want to stop. However, you should note that some mods don’t play well with other ones. In severe cases, the game won’t run properly, or at all. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of mods while preventing mishaps:
Script mods are a special type of Mod that must remain inside a zip file in order to work. You must also go to the game options menu (ESC Game Options Other Script Mods Allowed) to enable them. You can see this section in the menu in the screenshot further up where you also enable normal Mods and CC.

## Manage mods.

Note: If you have other mods and want to keep them organized, you can add one layer of the folder for the Mods folders. For example, you can create an MCCC folder within the Mods folder, but not another within the MCCC folder. If you do this, the mods will not be detected by the game.
What we mean to say is that, we think that every simmer, a newbie or a veteran, will find a lot of uses for the Mod Manager. Its main strengths are that it makes everything super simple, quick and easy to control. After a few minutes of using it, you will become a master and you will know where every mod file of yours is, whether it’s turned on or off, whether you need it or not…

Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
If you ask why, then you’re on the right track to make your life a lot easier. You see, the Mod Manager is a quality of life, fully developed software that helps you organize all The Sims 4 files.

The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
When you are done creating the category, you will quickly notice that it doesn’t appear on the main page. That is because there’s nothing in it yet! But, if you click on the “+” and add a mod or two, you will be asked if you want to store them in your newly created folder or not. If you choose to do so, the mods will be listed in that category on the main page.
The Mod & Custom Content Manager is described as a file explore with additional features which allows you to browse your files for The Sims 4 easily. You are able to delete and move files but also disable and enables files both on their own, in multiples or even whole folders. View files alongside thumbnails, which will help you distinguish content that is for Build Buy Mode or Create A Sim.
