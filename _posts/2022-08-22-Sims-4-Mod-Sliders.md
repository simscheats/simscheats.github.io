With sims 4 sliders, there are basically NO LIMITS! You can create insanely unique and beautiful sims. They’re also amazing for creating more diverse sims, as some features that are found within ethnicities have previously been difficult to create in CAS.
And finally, we have this awesome jawline slider for Sims 4! Creating the ideal jawline for your Sim is never easy in the basic Create a Sim menu. The lack of complexity in the option makes it very difficult to adjust the jaw in the exact way you want. And if you think the same, you’ll definitely love this jawline slider!
If you’ve ever felt like The Sims 4 doesn’t let you create a pair of long sexy legs for your Sim, I got some great news for you! The Leg Length slider by Dumbaby is one of the best Sims 4 sliders that I’ve ever installed. And I can recommend it to you with all my heart!
Honestly, this isn’t a must-have slider for all simmers out there. But if you’re anything like me and you absolutely need this for your female Sims, I suggest you give it a shot. It’s really interesting to create a unique height of boots for your Sim, so you might have fun too.

As a solution, I recommend you install this super cool belly slider mod created by hi-land. It’s a simple-to-use tool that allows you to select the shape and the size of your Sim’s stomach. Just drag the belly to whichever point you like and that’s it. And if you’re creative enough, you’re going to get some pretty realistic Sims in your game!
There are a lot of simmers out there who are looking to create less than realistic characters in The Sims 4 and these sliders are definitely for those types of players. These pointed ear sliders give you the opportunity to create a more elf-like aesthetic compared to a regular sim.
From now on, you’ll never have to worry about whether the glasses your Sim is wearing match their face. This slider is created by Evol_evolved and allows you to modify glasses based on size or face shape. You can also move or rotate them – so start rocking your perfect glasses or sunglasses today!

If you've always wanted to witness the miracle of childbirth in your virtual world, rather than the standard process of robotic baby delivery using special machinery, then the Realistic Childbirth mod from PandaSama (opens in new tab) is exactly what you're looking for. You'll need the Get to Work expansion to use it, but with everything installed your pregnant Sim will arrive at the hospital and go through several stages to induce labor for a natural delivery. Alternatively, there's the option for a planned C-section instead to skip the early labor stage, making the delivery just a quick epidural away.

Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever.

When you think of slider mods, the first one you are going to want to download is a good ol’ height slider so you can really adjust the height of your sims whether they be tall or short. One of the first mods to do this was by simmythesim in 2015 where a sim’s height was adjusted simply by moving the sim’s feet in the create a sim mode. However, a newer and updated version by GODJUL1 in 2017 improves the look of the animations when normal sims are interacting with overly short/tall modded sims in game.
We all know and love The Sims for all of the extensive customization it offers, but what could have been done better? Creators have gone ahead and made mods to add extra sliders to Create-A-Sim, allowing for Simmers to experience more freedom and creativity when designing their households. Here are just a few of the best Sims 4 slider mods we think are essential to a well-rounded Simming experience!
