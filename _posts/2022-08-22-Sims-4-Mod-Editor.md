## How to create a sims 4 mod.

If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)

By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
The Sims 4 has many unofficial mods and Custom Content that you can install to expand upon or improve gameplay, such as texture mods, new hairstyles and eye colors, custom houses, and more. This page teaches you everything you need to know about How to Install Mods in TS4 and where to find CC on PC and Mac.
Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
Installing Mods and Custom Content in The Sims 4 is very easy for both PC and Mac, if your aren’t sure how to do it, I wrote a quick but detailed tutorial for you to read. Most of the Mods or Custom Content files you can download are .package or .pyo/.py files that come in a compressed ZIP or RAR format.

The Sims 4 (TS4) is the fourth installment in The Sims franchise, a life simulation video game created and developed by Electronic Arts (EA) where you control human characters in various settings. Like the previous games in the series, The Sims 4 focuses on creating and controlling a neighborhood of virtual people called "Sims." The Sims 4 boasts an overhauled and intuitive Create a Sim menu, updated building tools, and deeper, more complex Sims through the addition of emotions and new traits. Compared to The Sims 3, TS4 is geared more towards low-end specs of its platform and simplicity in the whole game. A package file is a resource package file used by various EA games, including The Sims series. It stores an archive of one or more game files and may include 3D models, textures, sounds, and other game data, such as characters and neighborhood information. A package editor, on the other hand, is a program that is used to access, view, and modify the package files utilized by The Sims game franchise. This program allows players to tweak the game files to their liking and is the very foundation of The Sims mods. In this case, The Sims 4: Package Editor is what you’ll need to work with The Sims 4 if you want to break free from the base game’s coding.
I can’t find the Mods folder on the place where it should be, what can I do? When you open The Sims 4 for the first time, this map will automatically be generated. When the Mods folder still can’t be found here: C:\Users\(User Account)\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods create one yourself. Just make sure you’ll give it the right name: Mods
You can also use the Sims 4 Package Editor to clone things that are already in the game. That’s very useful when you want to create custom content! However, to do all these things you’ll need to know some programming. The package editor uses C# and needs Microsoft Visual Studio to work.
Mods are an excellent way to customize your Sims’ lives further and bring new challenges and items into the game. You’ll usually have more problems finding the content you like and installing it into the game. That’s a part of Sims 4’s charm. With so many community members, new custom content is available frequently.

## How to install a sims 4 mod.

Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
I have the Sims 4 cracked version. I do what is told to do to install Custom Content. But when I open the game, and go into the Mods folder, I cannot see my installed mods listed there. I do have the .cfg file in my Mods folder, but I still cannot get my mods in the actual game. What do you recommend I do?
That's the basics on how to install mods and custom content for The Sims 4, as well as how to troubleshoot, uninstall and keep your Mods folder organised! Got any questions or suggestions that I haven't covered above? Feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to help!
Question: Every time I try to download a custom content clothing it always says I need a new version for my PC and go to the software and publisher to find out what version I need and I do not know how to do that. How do I get the right version of the Sims 4?
Hello, i am not sure how to download anything onto my sims 4 game. Mostly because I downloaded from origin, so there is no disc. I had the sims 3 and it took me forever to figure out mods lol. But now I dont have a folder and the game isnt on my computer….its in origin. How do I download mods now?
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
Sims 4 Downloads - A site that watches blogs, MTS, and TSR to watch for new CC and Mods. Basically a Sims 4 downloads news feed that can help you get to some great content. You can browse by creator using their drop-down box and discover talented artists.
