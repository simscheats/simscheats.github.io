## How to create custom sims 4 mods.

You can find many mods over at ModTheSims, which hosts a wealth of community-made free mods for you to download and enjoy as you please. Installing mods is simple enough – all you need to do is drag the mod files over to the game’s mod folder. In a typical setup, this should be Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.

Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
The list of possible Sims 4 mods is basically endless. You can spend hours and hours looking through various websites, trying to find out whether a given mod is useful or just a waste of time. Over dozens of hours, we’ve tested a plethora of mods and hand-picked the ones most worthy of your attention. Through some trial and error, we’ve also listed which mods contradict each other and won’t function if both are installed at the same time.
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!

Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.
Remember that game mods and custom content are designed to work with genuine versions of The Sims 4. There is no guarantee that they will work with pirated versions of the game, so if you do have a pirated version and a mod isn't working, that could be why. The only way to fix this would be to buy a copy of The Sims 4 directly from Origin, where you can ensure the game will be patched regularly and compatible with all mods and custom content.

## Benefits of playing sims 4 mods.

Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience. Although the game is fun enough on its own (there's plenty of stuff you can do in The Sims 4 already), it gets even better when you're able to have more meaningful conversations, or fix the lag that's been bothering you. We selected some of the handiest, most entertaining, and most beautiful Sims 4 mods out there. Check the list to see which ones you like best, and you can install them right away!
And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?
These include activities like part-time jobs, gambling, and getting nails done. The best aspect of this mod is that the Sim can learn new skills and gain buffs. Players should note that while the mod works on the base game, it incorporates some aspects from some DLCs. Players without that specific additional content will be unable to reap the full benefits of relevant events.
This has made the game tenfold more fun for me. Sims emotions are much less predictable and you have to work that much harder to figure out how to make them happy. The mod includes an in-game tutorial as well as an in-game setting menu that lets you pick and choose the features you want in your game. I would recommend first going through the in-game tutorial before customizing your settings menu to get a good feel for the things you do and don’t want in your game.
With so many impressive Sims 4 mods out there, choosing the best ones is no easy task. Some of them fix common gameplay issues, while others add more depth to your Sims' stories. Whether you're looking for more cheats or just want to turn your Sims' world into a horror movie, there's something for everyone!
This mod isn't one that just makes your game slightly more realistic, it also helps to make your game a lot more fun. Currently, Sims take quite a while to do just about anything. But with this mod, at least one part of their life is sped up dramatically.
With the mod installed, you'll see a lot more options and choices at every stage of the child-rearing process in The Sims 4. For example, when you're talking about your Sim's infant, you'll have a lot more conversational topics to choose from. And when you interact with the bassinette, your options there will be enhanced as well.
