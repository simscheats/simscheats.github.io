## Simmers can now download a mod pack that allows them to change their sims' stances and postures.

The Pose Player mod is actually a large platform, and as such, can be further upgraded with more pose mods. You can search the internet for any type of poses you want, then download them and add them to your game files. In game, they will be sorted out and you will only need to choose which one you want your Sim to perform.

Ever tire of the fact that female Sims and male Sims have the same height? Well, not anymore. With the help of a downloadable Custom Content, this pose pack will enhance the height difference between the two Sims. The CC needed to make the poses seem real is the Leg Height Slider mod. If players are uncomfortable with this mod, it is possible to use this pack with the original height.
This is a mod that will add the option to play poses and animations in game. It adds an interaction to your sims called Pose By Name and Pose By Pack. Just click on your sim like you would to do anything else. When you choose the Pose By Name option, you can enter the name of the animation (I have attached a text file below with all EA in-game animation names below) and your sim will do that animation until you cancel the interaction. You can use it on your sim or any other sim even if it is not part of your sim's household. To stop a sim from posing, just click them again and you will have an option to stop the pose.
Have you ever asked yourself how those damn Instagramers make their Sims pose like that? What sort of mods and CC do they use for it? Their Sims don’t look like in-game characters at all, but real and alive people! Well, the secret is one and only one:Downloadlink: The Pose Player Mod
