However, if you own the latest update of the Sims 4 UI Cheats Extension and still have this problem, then it’s time to check your own system. There may be some apps or programs that interfere with the mod’s working. Also, reinstalling the game can also solve the problem.
Since the game's infancy, the Sims has always offered cheat codes to enhance gameplay and give players helpful bonuses. There's a cheat or a mod for almost everything; however, mods are a bit more complicated, even though the right ones can make for incredibly realistic gameplay. If you're not in the mood for downloading and meticulously organizing a bunch of files needed to make a mod, it's best to stick with good old cheat codes.
You absolutely NEED this mod if you are a player that cheats your sim’s needs a lot. To explain what this mod does in simplest terms, instead of having to type cheats codes into the cheats bar, you can visually click on things in the sims 4 UI (such as skills, needs, money, etc.) to alter them.
To enable cheats in the Sims 4 open the cheats console by holding CTRL + SHIFT + C then typing testingcheats on into the cheats console. You should receive a message back that says “Cheats are enabled.” This will allow you to use any cheat code in the sims 4. Hold CTRL + SHIFT + C again to close the cheats console.

It may not sound like help, but having the wrong version of the mod is 90% the case here. Sometimes a small update may change how the download works, so it’s best to first check the Patreon’s page.

In time of this writing, the latest update for the Sims 4 UI Cheats Extension is v1.23 in April 2021. The version officially launched on 03/03/2021, bringing a couple of cool changes to the mod.
