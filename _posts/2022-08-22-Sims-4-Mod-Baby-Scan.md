## Scan a newborn baby with the sims 4 mod baby scan.

This works by visiting a gynecologist and performing a scan. The doctor will then hand you photos of your baby (multiple photos are included) where you can view what’s inside the pregnant Sim’s belly. In the end, you can take these photos home and hang them on your walls as home decor items.

Going to get an ultrasound in real life is a huge moment and really make you feel connected with your baby and it’s disappointing that this isn’t a part of The Sims 4 proper. With the Ultrasound Scan Modyour sims will now have the ability to get themselves a pregnancy scan and even get a copy of the image into their inventory to place on their wall and keep forever.
They can find out about the gender and number of their babies, once they reach the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. What's super nice is that the ultrasound photos can be hung on walls and will provide a cool happiness moodlet to boost a pregnant Sim's spirits.
Babies are the best thing that can happen to anyone. They are the miracle of life and adorable little things. But, the whole baby experience in Sims 4 is lacking. There is no realism, no agony, nothing! Only a few things match the real-life version of getting pregnant and giving birth. So why not bring some realism into your game? Today, we bring you this amazing ultrasound mod for the Sims 4! Its name is Ultrasound Scan and it allows your sim to visit a gyno to get an exam. Let’s see how this mod works!
A pregnancy in the regular The Sims 4 game goes by super fast. In fact, within three days, your Sim can expect to be in labor at the hospital or at home, with their newborn baby in a crib. If this feels too unrealistic or quick, there's a great fix provided by Havem's mod.

If you don’t get an ultrasound scan, it could be because something doesn’t allow the script to give you the right buff. If you use other mods that affect the pregnancy data, for example: being pregnant with triplets etc. then this problem could arise.
With one exception (see Hospital Birth below), Sims will give birth only on their home lot. Once the pregnant Sim is at home and in labour, there are two choices: wait the three in-game hours for the baby to arrive, or speed things up by selecting the 'Have Baby' option (available both as a self-interaction and on any bassinets you may have already placed on the lot).
Say you want your Sim to have a baby that's their biological offspring, but don't want to wait three or four in-game days and deal with the hassle of pregnancy. The following cheat allows you to skip straight to labour once your Sim is confirmed pregnant (i.e. has the 'Eating for Two' moodlet).
It's hard work to be pregnant, and as the due date approaches, the unthinkable might happen, but not in The Sims 4. That is until this pregnancy mod is installed in the game. Polar Bear Sim's Labor Puddle mod will spawn a small puddle underneath a Sim that's gone into labor.

## Discover features and mods for the sims 4 mod baby scan.

In fact, this mod is a large combination of many different mods, some of which we mentioned above. It serves as a go-to extension whenever you plan to start a new family in Sims 4. It really makes the whole pregnancy experience complete and real-life-like. The collection is done by a few brilliant creators at ModTheSims. And you can find more through the link below!
For a simple combination of the essentials, the Pregnancy Mega Mod by scumbobo and java7nerd is an ideal pick for those who just want to have a bit more control over their offspring and increase the amount of storytelling that's available. This pregnancy mod for The Sims 4 is a combination of a few different ones and lets the player see how many babies a Sim will have, as well as their genders.
Next up on our list of sims 4 pregnancy mods is the baby maker trait which is hilarious! This trait’s description states “Babies, Babies, Babies! Can’t get enough of them. This sim wants lots of children. They are flirty very often and have many baby mamas or baby daddys to give them children. Commitment issues are possible if their significant other doesn’t give them enough children. Babies make the world go round!”
We recommend taking the scans out of your inventory and hang them around your sim’s house! If you choose to display them, they will give your sims a happy buff. They also come with 9 different frame swatches. That means that you’ll surely find one that fits with your house’s decor! You also have the option to rename the scans, so that you can keep track of your household’s babies. And if you change your mind and want to put them away, you can place them in storage chests too!
Tearing up limitations in The Sims 4 is what I always aspire to do, so this mod is a natural fit for me. And if you find the other mods on this list too large or not needed but you’d still like to have the freedom to choose which Sim will get pregnant in your game, I’d say download and install this mod!
One of the most exciting things about having a baby is wondering what their gender will be. In The Sims 4, if you don't play with mods or cheats you'll only know the baby's gender when it's born. But Littlemssam's Ultrasound Mod will let any simmer bring a touch of reality and excitement to their Sim's pregnancy. Using the Phone Travel Menu, your Sim will pay 75 simoleons to "Visit a Gynecologist."
