The hard part of having a big larger household mod is constructing the home. The residence has to be big enough for every Sim to possess a bit of private space and function. You certainly don’t bystander weird interaction in narrow places. And it’s entirely feasible for a Sim to pass away as well. Anyhow they cannot get away from a particular space.

Check out the selection of MCCC tuning options. I think you can access what you want via the computer, to denote household size. I stumbled across it recently.

I accidentally deleted them by not removing them from my Mods folder when I did a reset of my game. Face/palm. Now, I'll have to see if MCCC truly does allow for the larger households. If not, I believe I have a copy of that other mod. You can also click on the mail box for additional options for MCCC.

The reason why this regulation is so irritating is that some citizens like big households. Or relatively, we all occasionally want to play with huge families that possess further than 8 Sims in one dwelling. It’s fun, it’s appealing, and it’s innocuous!
