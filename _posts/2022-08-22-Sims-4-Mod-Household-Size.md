In all games, the number of Sims (and pets, if available) that can be in a household is limited. Without a pet-related expansion pack, household size is limited to eight. The The Sims: Unleashed and The Sims 4: Cats & Dogs expansion packs does not change this limit; a household can have any number of Sims and pets as long as the total does not exceed eight. The pets expansions for The Sims 2 and The Sims 3 keep the eight-Sim limit and limit the number of pets to six, but increase the household size limit to ten. This allows an eight-Sim household to have one or two pets. However, it is impossible to create a household with more than eight Sims and pets in Create a Sim in The Sims 2. The Sims 2 Pets for console decreases the household size limit to 6, and limits the number of pets to five which counts up to the household limit.[confirmation needed]
