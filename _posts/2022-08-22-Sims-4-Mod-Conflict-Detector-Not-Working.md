## Sims 4 mod conflict detector not working.

The Sims 4 Mod Conflict Detector is a powerful tool based on GUI which is used for detection & solving the mod conflicts found in this game. This program allows the gamers to remove the trouble-making Sims 4 mods, technically failing mods, empty mods, and so on.

A mod conflict detector for the Sims 4 is a well-built GUI (graphical user interface) tool that helps detect and solve mod conflicts in the game. It was first created by Dmitry Malfatto at Mod The Sims in February 2015 and regularly updated until 2018.
Hello! so two weeks ago I was playing sims 4 and so I decided I wanted to do a few cc shopping so I exit out the game. I accidentally downloaded some sims 3 content and it ended up in my sims 4 folder and so I had to use the mod conflict detector to find out what was wrong with my game and why wasn't it launching, since then I started a new mods folder with everything that was in my old folder and I got a message saying the game won't start up which is weird because its the same cc I've been using for months. Most of my cc is updated or some don't need to be updated but It still shows up in the Mod Conflict Detector as a 'mod conflict' and now I'm really confused because I don't know what to do.

If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
The loading priority for the mod in the game plays an important role in the way the game tackles the conflicts in the game resources. As a result, you can use the Sims 4, Sims 3, or Sims 2 mod conflict detector for finding the CC that has been creating a conflict in the game.
I use sims 4 mod manager and while it doesn't detect conflicts for you it does detect duplicates and you can "load"/"unload" mods to narrow down which one is screwing up your game. Way easier than doing it straight from your file manager. I have about 5000 mod files and there was one messing up my game. I found it no problem with the mod manager and in WAYYYY less time than if I did it via file explorer.
