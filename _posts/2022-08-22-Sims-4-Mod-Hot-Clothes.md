But with so many excellent clothing options to choose from, how do you know where to get started? Though you may discover more creators while searching for CC clothing, here are some fantastic Simmers to get you started.

The Sims 4’s Create A Sim includes a bundle of clothing pieces that are already presentable to you. However, there’s a whole different set of clothing items that show up in Create A Sim only after you complete a certain milestone / level in a certain Career / Skill.

If you need a quick refresher on Simmer modding slang: “BGC” means “Base Game Compatible,” meaning you don’t need any expansions to use that mod, and “mesh required” means that this is probably custom content made using someone else’s 3D model, which you’ll have to download.
