## Sims4 mods can let you change the temperature of various objects in-game.

Sim homes need climate control. Head to buy mode and go to the kitchen tab, then click the smoke detector to go to the alarms section. You can find a small thermostat to place on the wall there. When it's hot outside, set it to cool. When it's cold, set it to warm. Simple enough ,just like you do in reality. Know that Sims can do the opposite, and make the house hotter. This will absolutely kill someone if it's hot enough outside to cross the boundary from uncomfortable to extreme risk of death by heat stroke or hypothermia. You can tell which setting the thermostat is set to by the color of the ring. Know that this increases the bills of your household by at least 10%, so turn it back to normal when your Sims can tolerate the temperature.

If you don’t want to deal with Dr. June, the only real option is through mods. With the All Cheats Mod by TwistedMexi, you can cheat directly to change the weather. Obviously, this should be used as a last resort unless you’re more interested in the world of cheating at The Sims 4, since the game’s version of this mod tends to be… Just a touch nicer.
Disabling Seasions But Keeping its Stuff - Want to disable weather or make plants in season year-round? You can do so with my new Seasons Tuner ModImproving Sims 4: The past month, I've spent every day tinkering The Sims 4, making quality of life improvements, gameplay changes, and new difficulty settings for the game. If you'd like to learn more about my project, visit the post on Patreon where you can download it now.
If you’re okay with directing your sims to set the thermostat but wish they didn’t have to stop what they were doing to do so, this mod is for you! Just click the thermostat, select the appropriate setting and that’s it! No need to interrupt Harvestfest Dinner to keep the guests from freezing to death!
If you want to change weather in The Sims 4, you’ll need to find and purchase Dr. June’s Weather Control Device. It costs 1,500 Simoleons, and it will let you choose between every available weather type no matter the time of year. This is the fastest and most effective way to change the weather in The Sims 4 without having to resort to mods.

In addition, you have some minor control over the weather in the Options menu. You can basically turn off weather effects, and turn of temperature impacts on your sims. That means you won’t have to worry about a blizzard ruining one of your sims’ weddings, without having to drop 1.5k on a fancy new remote.
If we’re talking huge changes to your sims’ skins, though, check out this mod that changes your sims from doll faced mannequins to friggin’ supermodels. Higher definition, better contouring, eyes look far more realistic, and the eyebrows are hella on fleek now. Once installed, you’ll never be able to even look at the EA designed sims graphics again.
Note that this affects more than simply your Sims' comfort. If you set the thermostat to "Warmer" or during summer or "Colder" during winter, it will significantly reduce the cost of your family's bills, though your Sims will likely draw stronger debuffs. Conversely, if you choose "Colder" during summer or "Warmer" during winter, your bills will go up but your Sims will draw buffs due to being more comfortable.
This is super cool. Grab the original Sims game– the one that started it all– and its iconic game case covers, and throw them on some frames as art around your household. Beautiful. You’ll have some legit Sims meta-ness going on. This mod makes this all possible.

## This mod disables the “no cold clothing” option in the game.

Well, this mod makes it so that when your sim gets home from work, they’ll change into their everyday clothing. Like normal humans do. This is even if they’re planning on leaving right away. Oh, and it only happens when your sim arrives home while wearing work attire.
This mod requires you to have Seasons as it changes the temperatures up to kind of emulate other parts of the world. In the “Winter” it can be hot, in the “Summer” there might be a massive snowstorm. The Seasons Temperature Change mod really opens up the possibilities of acting like your sims are in another part of the world that doesn’t necessarily follow the North American rules of weather.
You know how sims love to drop everything they’re doing and tell you what they’re feeling? When they’re hot, they stop to fan themselves, when they’re cold, they stop to shiver. With this mod, they’ll continue to fan and shiver just while they do other things. Definitely worth checking out if you find the time they take to perform idle animations annoying.
Every single time you buy something new, your nosy little sim wants to check it out. Well, this mod shuts them right up and turns off the autonomous “Check new object” action. No longer will they friggin’ go right to the new object as though it just magically appeared in their house. They should be way more freaked out if that were the case.
This mod sets out to not make the “Warm and Cozy” buff no longer pop out when the temperature is unholy for it. If the weather outside is already hot or if it’s way too cold, you won’t unrealistic get the moodlet buff from a simple fireplace or anything else. It’ll be way harder to make your sim feel warm and cozy, basically.
This mod can be pretty useful because if you’ve noticed from the vanilla game, it needs to be later in the night for you to ask to stay over at a sim friend’s house. This can be problematic if you happen to forget to ask at the appropriate time and get kicked out. Luckily, you can now just ask to stay over way earlier while you’re there (or even later), as “inappropriate visits” no longer exist and you can just get that question in whenever you want.
This mod provides some random immortality tweaks such as allowing sims that ask for a longer life wish from the genie lamp to be immortal, making mummies immortal, and making unicorns immortal. It expands upon other mods that also do this sort of thing, by the way.
The loading screen can be pretty bland. Sure, there are the cute messages (Reticulating splines, anyone?), but if you’re a hardcore sim fan, you’ve seen it enough times. This mod spruces it all up and adds some custom loading screens for each expansion pack. A minor, but welcomed change complete with silly messages.
