## How to get two jobs in the sims 4.

Can a Sim have two jobs in The Sims 4? Sims cannot have two full-time jobs or multiple full-time jobs in The Sims 4. They can pursue only one specific career path full-time. They cannot hold one full-time job and a part-time job either. However Sims can have two part-time jobs at once.

In The Sims 4, may a Sim have two jobs? In The Sims 4, Sims cannot work two full-time jobs or numerous full-time jobs. They are limited to pursuing just one professional option full-time. They can’t work full-time and part-time at the same time. Sims, on the other hand, may work two part-time occupations at the same time.
i don't know if it is possible to have two jobs at the same time but i do know its possible to quit your job and start a new without losing your current level (meaning know matter how many jobs you have and quit your level will stay when you re join) at least that what happen to me i leveled up in every career and before deciding to re join a previous career- sims 4
As you can see, Sims can’t have more than one full-time job or career at a given time. Of course, this question makes perfect sense. More jobs means more money. And the more money your Sim has, the better. They can use it to upgrade their lifestyle and purchase expensive items.
Have you ever wished your sim could work more than one career or multiple part time jobs like you can in real life? Well, look no further because with this mod, you’ll be able to work as many of the in game jobs as you’d like! You can work two+ careers, a career and two+ part time jobs, as an actor/actress in addition to a career or part time job and even become a freelancer outside your 9-5! The possibilities are endless, so work your own way with the Sims 4 Unlimited Jobs Mod today!

In The Sims 4, teenagers and older can work part-time jobs. Part-time jobs do not interfere with a teen's school schedule, but they can't have a job and enroll in an afterschool activity simultaneously. Sims older than teenagers can work up to two part-time jobs, provided their schedules don't interfere. Part-time jobs all have three levels.
A part-time job is a type of job available in The Sims 2, The Sims 3, and The Sims 4. Part-time jobs have shorter working hours, fewer levels within the career track, and usually offer lower pay than full jobs. A Sim cannot hold a part-time and a regular full-time job at the same time. Teens and elders can work part-time jobs in all three games, whereas young adults and adults can only work these jobs in The Sims 3 and The Sims 4.
The Sims 4 allows players to create their own tiny little simulated people, and give them jobs that they can hold down simultaneously. However, some creators have taken this a step further by giving the AI characters multiple careers at once. This article covers how to do it and what are the pros/cons of doing so.
Sims can’t have more than one full-time job or profession at a time, as you can see. Of sure, this is a reasonable question. Greater jobs imply more income. It’s also preferable if your Sim has a lot of money. They may utilize it to improve their lifestyle and buy high-priced goods.

## How to get two jobs in the sims 4 seasons.

You would have to make sure the hours didn't conflict. The teen jobs for everyone mod is useful for giving second jobs to sims with a daytime career already. (Note: I haven't actually tested this in my game yet any further than actually assigning the jobs, which does work, but I have seen other people play through and say that it works. ETA: I just tested through a whole work session with both jobs and it was fine, got paid for both, got progress for both. The only problem is the game only seems to store one work outfit, so they'll wear the outfit for the newest job to both jobs.)
And there you have it! I hope I helped you understand how working from home actually works in The Sims 4. It’s all tied with the profession you choose for your Sim, so that’s the first you need to take care of. Choosing a semi-active career is a great move, and it’s definitely fun to play with. Take one more look at the list and decide what your Sim will work on while being in the comfort of their home!
In The Sims 2, teens are only eligible to work part-time jobs. Part-time jobs have hours that do not interfere with a teen's school schedule. Reaching the top of a part-time career track is a prerequisite to fulfilling the "Overachiever" want for teens. Teens cannot get a part-time job if their grades are poor.
Just as in real-life, your Sims have to get a job to put bread on the table. The system is the same: your Sim wakes up in the morning, gets ready for work, gets at the office or goes to their home office, and starts working. When the 8 hours of work are over, they get to do whatever they want in their free time.
Working from is a dream for many of us. And naturally, we also wish that our Sims could work from home too. It’s understandable – we’d like to have our Sims all to ourselves, and we don’t want them to be forced to disappear in their daily jobs for hours. So, how do you work from home in Sims 4?
What I tend to do with an household is have one of the sims learn to write or paint and max up these skills before getting them a job. Paintings will provide you with nice one-off payments whilst the books will provide you with a nice steady income. Only then do I set them off on a career path. If you choose writer or artist then you've got the added bonus of achieving a lot of the goals already, hence you're able to get promoted quicker. The painting skill has the added bonus of - once you're skilled enough - being able to enable auras on paintings. Placed in the right places these can benefit your other skills/work moods too.
In The Sims 3, Sims aged teen or older can take a part-time job. These jobs pay less per hour, but have fewer hours overall, so they are not as time-consuming as full-time jobs. All part-time jobs only have 3 levels, and Sims cannot retire from part-time jobs, so they will not receive pensions. Sims can apply directly at the work place for all part-time jobs. Performance options are limited to: Business As Usual (normal workday), Work Hard (more performance, but more stress), and Take It Easy (less performance, but less stress). Promotions are dependent only on mood. Sims employed in a part-time job will not receive any career opportunities.
Buzzler's mod allows sims who do not have a particular career to "work a shift" in it. I believe that shouldn't disturb their assignment to their original career nor their progression through it, if things are working as intended, and in that case it would just be a way to earn some extra cash on the side.
