## Sims 4 vampire mod that removes the weakness stat from vampires.

This one's much easier - Traits.Remove_Trait Trait_OccultVampire will immediately remove the Vampire trait from your Sim. This is required to be a vampire in the game engine, so your Sim will switch back to normal and lose all their powers and weaknesses.

This mod allows your Vampire Sim to NOT HAVE to take any weakness while progressing through Vampire levels/stages. You're still able to select a weakness (as long as it does not conflict with a power) if you choose to do so, but you no longer have to. You can be an all mighty and powerful Vampire with no weaknesses, or be silly and have a Vampire with all weakness and no powers. You're free to play with your powers and weakness as you choose.
The Sims 4 vampire reset power cheat codes we are going to share with you today will help in removing weaknesses without giving up the rest of your powers or refunding power points. And it doesn't stop there- we'll even be able to reset the power board as well!
To remove vampire weakness points, you’ll first need your vampire’s sim ID. To get this, open up the cheat box and use the cheat code sims.get_sim_id_by_name {Firstname} {Lastname}. In return, you’ll get the sim ID. Write this down and then enter in the cheat code bucks.lock_all_perks_for_bucks_type 40962 {simID} false filling it in with the sim ID you just got. Now your vampire will no longer have their weaknesses, but keep all of their powers.
Note 2: There is a sticky in the post section by Einhornyordle. You can try their method about using all weakness points before installing this mod in order to use this mod on existing vampires. Drink the reset potion after using all points and installing. More details are on their post.

Vampires cheats are a bit more complex than other types, so let's do a tutorial on how to use them. With these, you have the power to change your Sim into a Vampire or remove the vampire occult trait from a Sim, reverting them back to normal. We can also add and remove vampire powers using cheats, though using specific traits is actually the most difficult type to use because it involves Sims.Get_Sim_By_ID_By_Name. I curate my main Cheats page but do not like to get too specific there, so here are the vampires cheats in detail.
Product: The Sims 4Platform:PCWhich language are you playing the game in? EnglishHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)What is your current game version number? 1.77.146.1030What expansions, game packs, and stuff packs do you have installed? All of themSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Play a vampire who is already a grand master vampire such as Vlad. They will have 5 vampire weakness points, which means they will have to have 5 vampire weaknesses. Then use a cheat code to lower their vampire rank such as stats.set_stat rankedStatistic_Occult_VampireXP 202 to send them back to being only a minor vampire. Although a minor vampire should have only 1 weakness point and so should need to take only 1 weakness, your vampire will still have 5 weakness points and so will need to take 5 weaknesses. And when you play your vampire and have them reach the next vampire rank another weakness point will be added. So, if they become a prime vampire, they will now have 6 weakness points rather than the 2 that they should have as a prime vampire and thus will need to take 6 weaknesses instead of 2. What happens when the bug occurs? Vlad is a grand master vampire. I used a cheat code (NOT any mods) to make him a fledgling vampire again. A grand master vampire has 5 weakness points so as a grand master Vlad had 5 weakness points. When I made him a fledgling again, his weakness points should have been reset to 0 since a fledgling vampire has no weakness points. But his weakness points instead stayed at 5. Every time a vampire increases their vampire rank, the game gives them one additional weakness point and this happened to Vlad even though he was starting out with 5 weakness points already (instead of the zero he should have begun with as a fledgling). So, when he became a minor vampire he game gave him another weakness point and he then had 6 weakness points and when he became a prime vampire he got another weakness point so that he now had 7 weakness points. By the time he reached grand master, he had 10 weakness points which is double the number of weakness points that a grand master should have (grandmasters have 5 weakness points ordinarily). What do you expect to see? I expect that when you lower a vampire's vampire rank, their weakness points will also reduce to the number of weakness points appropriate for that rank e.g. if you have a grand master vampire and make them a fledgling, their weakness points would go from 5 to 0.Have you installed any customization with the game, e.g. Custom Content or Mods? Not now. I've removed them.Did this issue appear after a specific patch or change you made to your system? No‌I attach a picture of the vampire powers panel of a vampire whose rank has been reset from grand master to fledgling. As you can see, he has kept the 5 weakness points that he had as a grandmaster. As a fledgling vampire he should have 0 weakness points.Edit By Crinrict: Added Tag to Title
Well, after looking the game up and down, there is really no way to turn my Vampire sim into a normal sim, without having to get to Vampire Lore level 15.. Which is a lot of work... No worries, though! I FOUND a solution! If your sim is a vampire, you press CTRL-SHIFT-C, and then type in "testingcheats on" (without the quotation marks.) Then, you are going to select the sim who is a vampire, and type in "traits.remove_trait trait_OccultVampire" (without the quotation marks.) Sadly, this only works when you are actually in the world.(Hope this helps anyone that is lazy... Like me... Lol.)
If stuff like this happens to just one sim, and not all vampires, I'd say embrace it. Make him weaker than he is supposed to be according to game. I like the strength/weakness system, but never paid too much attention. I more try to make them a bit different by avoiding picking the same strengths and weaknesses for all my vamps. It's the same as with general traits etc, I'm probably not the only one picking the same options over and over again.

## Higher skill cap for vampires, making them substantially more difficult to kill.

Lowers the amount of Vampire Energy regained from sleeping. Not a huge problem if your vampire doesn't have a conventional career, but it will require you to lean more heavily on reading Vampiric Lore tomes to gain experience points since you won't be able to use as many powers.
Increases the threshold needed to switch Emotions, thus keeping the vampire at Fine or Happy much easier. This might be a negative if you try to min-max your emotions to maximize your Skill gains, but it's useful to resist negative emotions like Sad or Angry.
They also have special requirements that you'll need to pay close attention to, such as power points to fuel their special vampire powers, or how to fill up their vampire energy. And then there's the matter of turning your regular Sim into a vampire. You can do that too, with cheats!
Significantly increases the damage the sun will do the vampire. Can be taken multiple times, but at high levels this can be instantly lethal if the vampire wanders outside with low Vampire Energy. Be very careful if taking this weakness; always keep an eye on your vampire, especially when Free Will is on.
Vampires get Power Points to purchase Perks as they level up, but must choose Vampire Weaknesses each time they gain a major rank. It's possible to use cheats to reset vampire powers and weaknesses. You can even give your vampire 0 weaknesses if you like!
Allows the ability to turn normal human Sims to vampires. The command to do this must be given; a turning will not happen with a simple or frenzied bite. Note that if your vampire plans on having or siring a baby, this power is irrelevant to whether their offspring is a vampire.
But just keeping the vampires away isn’t enough. Warding them off will just send them after some other, less protected human. Continue learning the Vampire Lore skill. At this point, it’s also a good idea to start building your Fitness skill as well. You will need both physical strength and extensive knowledge of vampires to take one down.
There are no restrictions for vampires, or other occult sims to have this trait. Also, there can be relationship between Slayer and Vampire. I based this trait on few inspirational sources from movies, literature etc. and I wanted to create something for storytelling, and not to limit ourselves :)
