These are some of my absolute favourite sims 4 cc toddler beds because they cover such a range of styles. You can find beds that are extremely stylized but also neutral options for simpler rooms. You’ll definitely find at least one bedroom set that you love and need in your mods folder. Happy playing!
This set has a bunch of adorable clutter options to decorate your favourite kid’s room with. The furniture you see isn’t included but the tiny tent, the mountains, the art work and more is included and can really decorate your toddler’s room in the best way.
Your sim may note the presence of the items or furniture in the room, such as the guitar, teddy bear, football, and lantern, in addition to the image hanging on the wall depicting a bicycle, so that your sim child may pick and practice a passion that he enjoys from childhood.
