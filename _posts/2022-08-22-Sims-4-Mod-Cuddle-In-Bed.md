## Sims 4 players can now cuddle in bed together.

The bed animations for Sims 3 were so cute and actually felt realistic. One sim could relax on the bed reading a book while the other is in the shower then the other sims relaxes on the bed they cuddle, talk about their days, kiss, makeout, then woohoo. Then they go to bed and would cuddle in their sleep.

As we discussed earlier, the default after woohoo in a double bed in the game is for your sims to just go to sleep and not talk to each other or cuddle at all. The pillow talk mod will give you a few new interactions for your sims to do while sitting in bed after woohoo making it a much more realistic and fun experience for your sims to bond.
With this mod by Sacrificial, which can be downloaded here, your Sims can enjoy a slow romantic dance together. Unlike in the regular game, Sims will put their arms around each other and gaze at each other, looking totally smitten. They can also be prompted to hug or have a little make-out session while dancing. While this is going on, they will get flirty moodlets, and their romance bar for the couple will increase.
I have this same issue. I find it ridiculous two friends cannot share a bed. For a game that claims it "simulates life" there are still way too many barriers that limit how closely you can imitate real life. Why do Sims need a romantic relationship to share a bed? Platonic friendship is important and there's nothing wrong with two friends sharing a double bed. Who didn't share a friend's bed at least once in their life? I know it's common to just sleep on the floor but in my experience that's only because there are more than two people involved. I have two Sims who are "true friends" sharing a small apartment together. There is plenty of room for one double bed. I tried having them share it, but they refuse despite being "true friends". Why is that, EA? Why do Sims need to be romantically involved to simply share a bed? Seems odd, to me.
@BrynnasaurusRexIt would seem this is by design and might be related to the game rating or to allow for different cultural beliefs.Though it seems logical for siblings to sometimes share a bed in real life it does not happen in game.There is an option now (added to base game) to upgrade beds.This allows players to use the cheaper beds and upgrade them to provide a more positive moodlet and better comfort relief.

The article below suggests you some good Sims 4 romance mods, where you tend to fall in love with your desired partners and NPCs. Read the material more to know about these modules in detail along with some cute animations. Download these modifications now and play with this exciting feature.
Any time that you have two sims woohoo in The Sims 4 (in a bed) they are immediately going to fall asleep which isn’t realistic in all situations. Plus, if they are woohooing in the middle of the day it can just mess up their energy need and sleep schedule for the night. The no sleep after woohoo mod makes it so that your sims won’t go straight to sleep by default after they woohoo, a simple change, but it does change something that has always annoyed me.
Wanting your sims to woohoo all starts with romance and flirting, and the passionate romance mod will make the process of getting to woohoo way more fun. This mod adds simple things that I’ve missed so much in The Sims 4 like some old interactions like goose, snuggle, and make out which were all options in The Sims 2. It also allows you to take romantic selfies with your significant other.
Agreed.When I was a broke student I had a house party and ended up with six people sleeping the night in my queen size bed. It's a thing that happens irl, we should be able to do it in sims - both sleeping in the same bed without being romantically involved, and having more than the intended number sleeping in a bed. I'd expect a lower sleep quality if you have two in a single bed for the night or more than two in a double bed, but they should be able to sleep like that, and siblings or friends should be able to sleep in the same bed without anything else being assumed about it.

## The new mod adds a bed to sims 4 player's homes.

Fans were somewhat irritated by how often the bed would actually malfunction, and so modders came to the rescue again by reducing the amount of times these beds would drive Sims to the brink of insanity. Modder Teknikah released this handy mod to ensure every Simmer can enjoy the Murphy bed without fear of death.
While patiently waiting for more news on a possible The Sims 5, however, the best way to spice up the current version of the game is to add some custom content and mods. There are some incredible modders out there, who have not just made The Sims 4 better but also brought back crucial features from previous game. Here are the best mods every Simmer needs for better gameplay.
Is EA looking at this bug yet? With new pack Tiny Living coming out, it would be great to bring back scoot on bed with double bed against wall. We used to be able to. It was very helpful in game since many computers and laptops are low end, so we need tiny homes. This bug messes up my tiny family builds. I haven't actually PLAYED in a long time so I didn't know till recently that I can't use those rooms anymore for couples. I tried everything I could to make them both get on the bed and scoot, but it never works. Tried to cancel sleep and make them go to other side, tried to make them both go on at once, tried with nap, nothing. There's no relax on bed option either so I can't use that method to try to scoot him over. nap, sleep, sit, assign bed, great relationship, auto sleep panel button, nothing works. This makes gameplay feel very dumb and frustrating, wish they'd fix this soon, hopefully before I finish collecting cc and start building again. I'd like to play again some day.Even if I had a gaming PC, I'd still want this function back, I love making and playing in tiny homes, and this function was one of the options I really loved and appreciated about this game. It may seem simple and useless to EA, or others, but to many players, it was very useful and it's missed.It's the little things in this game that make this game feel more realistic, and it's too bad that the little details get passed over so much in this game when patch day comes around.
This all-in-one mod allows you to control just about everything from slowing your Sim's need decay to letting you have some control over non-player Sims. The MCCC mod has an additional package of mods designed explicitly for issues pertaining to woohoo.
Thewicked whims mod is probably the most popular and most well known NSFW mods for The Sims 4. With this mod you’ll have changes to how woohoo works, nudity, pubic hair, strip clubs and so much more. This mod has so many interesting aspects to it that it can’t be easily summarized here, you just have to see it for yourself.
If you know anything about mods in The Sims 4, you should know that MC Command Center is just a must have mod to begin with. This mod allows you to completely control so many parts of the game, and there is an entire section for MC Woohoo and MC Pregnancy. The types of things you can see is polygamy, autonomous try for baby, risky woohoo percentage changes, and so much more. There are so many aspects to this mod that make it a necessity in the game.
What do you mean by it leaves room for more cultural beliefs? Limiting the game options isn't leaving room for anything. Two Sims being unable to share a bed unless they're romantically involved, married, or family is odd. Friends can share a bed in real life without there being anything romantic or sexual about it. It's definitely "by design" and that design is flawed. A game that "simulates life" shouldn't limit these things.
This mod allows your Sim to create delicious meals such as tandoori chicken, peach pie, and apple salad just to name a few. When you install this mod, be sure to check out the #Custom food tag on modthesins.info to get the latest and greatest of custom foods!
