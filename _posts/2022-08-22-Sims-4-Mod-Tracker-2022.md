## Sims 4 mod tracker is a mod tracking tool for the sims 4.

Deciding your Sims' weight and muscle mass is as easy as moving a slider or pushing their bodies around in The Sims 4, but isn't it weird that every single person in your world is the same height? Unnatural right? Well, this height slider Sims 4 mod from GODJUL1 (opens in new tab) fixes all of that, adding natural stature variations to your neighbourhoods.

Sometimes, a mod doesn't have to be complicated to make a big difference to your game. By simply adding two new traits to the game, this mod from Vitorpiresa grants the player access to a brace of important abilities that many would find... unnatural.
Brought to us by a creator called Kawaiistacie, The Life Decider is designed to 'give your Sims a head start in life' along with giving them a little history. For your own custom-made Sims, it will give them a career straight off the bat, as well a bonus trait, skills and income.
We’re talking about putting everything in the right place, renamed and clear folders, the ability to turn on and off certain mods whenever you want, to put every CC you’ve ever gotten in a correct library… It is truly an invaluable tool and a real time saver!
The Meaningful stories mod is a combination of the emotional Inertia Mod and the Happiness Mod. With this mod, the characters have a more natural mood change rather than the sudden and often-robotic-like mood changes that occur in the default function.

## Sims 4 mod tracker can help you find and download mods for the sims 4.

You can find many mods over at ModTheSims, which hosts a wealth of community-made free mods for you to download and enjoy as you please. Installing mods is simple enough – all you need to do is drag the mod files over to the game’s mod folder. In a typical setup, this should be Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.
Creator and player luthienrising has compiled a huge list of Broken and Updated Mods for The Sims 4 over at The Sims Forums. Highlighting some of the affected areas after the latest update, as well as keeping track of Mods that are outdated and don’t work and Mods that have been updated after the recent Patch.
And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?
You just need to look at the game’s strong library of user generated content to see what’s really keeping the lights on. The Sims 4 mods scene is thriving, with plenty of weird and wonderful additions to the base game. We’ve compiled a list of what we think are the best Sims 4 mods accompanied with links to all the download pages. Be sure to read the install instructions for each mod.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience. Although the game is fun enough on its own (there's plenty of stuff you can do in The Sims 4 already), it gets even better when you're able to have more meaningful conversations, or fix the lag that's been bothering you. We selected some of the handiest, most entertaining, and most beautiful Sims 4 mods out there. Check the list to see which ones you like best, and you can install them right away!
From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.
With so many impressive Sims 4 mods out there, choosing the best ones is no easy task. Some of them fix common gameplay issues, while others add more depth to your Sims' stories. Whether you're looking for more cheats or just want to turn your Sims' world into a horror movie, there's something for everyone!
