## Create a sims 4 mod private practice.

Well, this is where the private practice mod for Sims 4 comes to play. This mod contains nearly all the necessary health aspects that you might need in a video game. It covers most medical categories and can take of your Sim, no matter the problem they might have.

As you can see, the private practice mod is a complete feature. It aims to replace the health system in Sims 4, and I’d say that it does that successfully. I honestly recommend everyone to at least try this mod, simply because it makes the gameplay more realistic and engaging. Good luck!

The health system in Sims 4 is far from perfect. Hospitals and emergencies are practically nonexistent, except for pregnant Sims. Your Sims almost never get seriously ill, and for every medical problem they have, they can simply take a pill for it! You can see why this is so unrealistic, especially when considering that the game is a simulation of the real world. And that’s exactly the reason why I want to tell you all about the private practice mod for Sims 4!

In case you are new to this Private Practice process, this section will get you started on preparing your save for the new options provided by this mod. To get started, you will need a lot with the Private Practice Lot Trait. Thiscanbeanytypeoflotthatisnon-residential except for LittleMsSam's Medical Clinic. If you would like just a Clinic, you can use the Generic lot type with this lot trait. I made a test clinic (Newcrest Health Center) for you as well, so you don't have to immediately build one. It will provide an example of what you will need for each function of the Clinic and see the potential for additional features to come. You can then build whatever kind of Clinic you would like. To add my test Medical Center to your game, you can either use the tray files included in the mod download and put it in your Tray folder, or you can look up the EA Account ID: SimRealist. When placing a pre-built Medical Clinic or Center, please be sure to go into Build Mode, confirm the correct lot type and trait, and then SAVE before attempting your first appointment.

@Kira101x said: No, you cannot run your own practice (unfortunately). It's just there for decor so it looks like you can have a home practice. You can, however, sell the items in a retail store like a medical supplies wholesale thing but no treating sick sims. Hope this helps! :)

## Find sims 4 mod private practice clients.

The private practice mod for Sims 4 was created by SimRealist. It’s not a new mod by all means, but it receives a regular update once in a while that keeps it fresh and new. Also, new updates also mean new features for the mod, like career branches and other stuff.
MEDICAL CLINIC: This new lot is set up similar to SNB – Financial Center. Just place the Lot trait on any non-residential lots and Private Practice NPCs will come and assist your Sims. More NPCs and features to come with the Sickness & Illnesses update that is currently in development.
The release of Private Practice 2.0.0 included Kate Emerald's Clinics and Center, which l also made available for you to use with this mod. They will be available in the Gallery under the SimRealist name as well. We've also included both the Generic (Newcrest) Health Center and Kate's builds in the download attached for your convenience.
When it is time, you will see a pop-up to start the appointment. With version 2.3, you have three options available to you when your Sim's appointment starts. You can go with them, send them off by themselves, or cancel the appointment if your Sim needs to attend to something else. For the In-Person option, the mod will send your Sim(s) to the location of their appointment. Once there, follow the Guidance System for this Appointment. It will tell you what you need to accomplish with each patient scheduled.

The Private Attorney Branch of the Law Career requires your Sim to grow more Charismatic, in order to take on new clients and offer them representation. Building just a little friendship will help with this, and your clients are tracked so you'll need to work with new Sims. Overall its rewards are the same as the Judge.
I want to note that "offer legal representation" when you don't work from home is nearly impossible to complete- it takes about 4 successful offers to get 25% completion, meaning you end up spending all night after work tracking down 16 people to talk to who aren't already your clients.
When you start a new save or a save that didn't have Private Practice loaded in, your Sims will start to experience symptoms of either an illness or allergy. Your Sim's world NPCs will also get ill. You can't send those NPCs to the clinic, they have to run through a Herd Immunity process. Their illnesses should be less frequent after that first exposure. You can handle your active Household though by sending them to the Clinic to be diagnosed and have access to the needed medication.
