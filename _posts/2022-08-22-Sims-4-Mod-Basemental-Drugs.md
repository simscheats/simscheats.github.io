The Basemental Drugs mod for The Sims 4 is an adult-oriented illegal drug-use mod that adds to gameplay. The mod is not suitable for minors or those who may find reckless drug use triggering or offensive. With the mod, sims in the game have the ability to use illegal drugs in a recreational manner, whether it be teens or elders. While the mod can appear to glorify drug use, sims will have negative effects from drug use and have to deal with addiction, rehabilitation, and even death.
The Sims 4 can be very fun to play, but some may find the game to be a bit mild with content and may want to inject some more mature content into their gaming. The Basemental Drugs mod adds a degree of danger and illegality to the game that's quite revolutionary. And it's easy to install and play!
A variety of drugs are available for sims, as well as some complementary features like illegal actions (selling drugs, growing marijuana, etc.), police to avoid, and even parenting actions like catching your teen with drugs. The level of drug use in the game, whether police can arrest you, and many of the other aspects can be modified to your liking.
Anyone caught dealing will be in big trouble. And whoever doses too carelessly will soon be visited by the Grim Reaper. The Sims 4 drug mod even simulates the side effects of drugs, depending on the product used. It will even intervene in the social life of the Sims.

Drugs are not an issue in The Sims 4. This is hardly surprising, since the game is targeted at an international and, of course, a very young audience. However, there are mods for the adults and Basemental is absurdly popular, especially with it Sims 4 drug mod.
The Sims 4 drug mod, in which Sims can grow, smoke and sell weed, among other things, delivers a whole branch of industry at once. Therefore, if you want to play Breaking Bad in the basement, you’re in the right place. You can choose from a wide range of substances, from amphetamines to ecstasy and coke. The mod doesn’t leave out any detail.
Alcohol is added alongside the other drugs, which adds various real-life drinks for mixologists to make, and changes "juice" added in Discover University to beer. Sims drinking lots of alcoholic drinks will become drunk, and prolonged drinking may give a sim the alcoholic moodlet. Sims can also drunk text while drunk. Lots can be given the "Bouncer" lot trait, which will add a bouncer NPC to the lot that will stop teen sims from entering at the door. Teens can get a fake ID from a dealer that will allow them to bypass the bouncer.
The most prominent feature of the mod is its range of drugs for sims to experiment with. The list includes cannabis (weed), tobacco, cocaine, amphetamine, shrooms, MDMA, ayahuasca, xanax, lean, adderall, LSD, and steroids. The mod also includes edits to mixology that adds new drink recipes, as well as the ability for sims to become drunk, and even alcoholics. The drugs are acquired in differing and semi-realistic ways, with not all being available for purchase in buy mode. The only drugs available in buy mode are cocaine, amphetamine, MDMA, and tobacco. Cannabis seeds are included for gardening (incorrectly categorized in Indoor Plants, rather than with the other seed packets in Outdoor Activities), as well as rolling papers, weed curing jars, and bongs. Drugs can form addictions (which will result in an addiction moodlet for the affected sim), and repeated use of drugs in a short period of time can result in a sim's death by overdose. If WickedWhims is installed, sims can pay dealers for drugs with sex. A sim or household that frequently sells drugs may be subject to police busts or swat raids, in which they will be taken to jail and have their inventory items confiscated.

## Modifying the "basementaldrugs" xml file.

Any of the Optional Packages files can be dragged into other Basemental Drugs folders if you want to add them to the game. If you want to get rid of one (like Real Drink Names), drag it into the Optional Packages folder. Make sure upon launching the game that you have Script Mods and Custom Content/Mods enabled within the Game Options and Other section of settings.
You can either search for “Empty Weed Jar” in the buy mode, purchase it and then place it, or go to the head store with your sim from computer or tablet and buy it there. Once your sim has 15 buds of the same type of plant in inventory, you can click on the Empty Weed Jar and select “Cure Weed”.
