## Create and share mods with other sims players.

The Sims 4 makes it easier than ever: simply download the mod in question, unzip the files (they will typically end in .package), and then drag and drop them into the "Mods" folder, which is already located in your Sims files (navigate to Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4Mods to locate).

There are also lots of automatic settings geared towards letting non-controlled Sims live full lives without you, getting married and having babies of their own volition, and you can also use the mod to adjust the in-game time settings so your Sims don’t take half a day to shower and have breakfast. If you only grab one mod, make it this one.

The options for mods are pretty diverse. I've seen everything from one for The Sims 2 which added horses to the game (and yes, Sims could even ride them—and this was way before the Pets expansion pack added horses to The Sims 3), to one for Sims 3 which added in a working Ferris wheel. Some are much less complex, just restructuring the regular game files to add in or change things (like a Sims 3 mod which allows late-night bars to stay open 24 hours instead of closing at 2 a.m., or the most famous mod of all, the one that removes the pixelation on nude Sims and replaces it with body parts).
With this mod installed, you'll notice that 'idle chat' has been totally removed, with Sims being forced to have meaningful interactions instead of filler at every opportunity. Using their traits and moods and other pointers, the game will find things for Sims to talk about whenever they interact.
The good news is modding your game isn’t as hard as you think. Sims Community is here to help. We’ll be clarifying any technical terms you might come across while looking for mods and CC, dispelling common myths about mods and CC, and walking you through the process of installing and maintaining your mods and CC step-by-step.
If you’re a Sims player who’s never delved into the world of mods and CC before, getting started with customizing your game can feel overwhelming. Where do you even start looking? Where do all those files go? Don’t mods and CC give you viruses? What do all these techy terms mean? Why do all your mods keep breaking whenever you update the game? How do you fix it?

## Create and share mods with other game developers.

The number one thing you need to know about mods is that they break. They break a LOT. After almost every single game update, in fact. This means that you’ll be redownloading your mods constantly. If this sounds like too much hassle for you, then mods are probably not for you. If you are willing to keep your Mods folder maintained on a regular basis, then continue reading!
Hey guys! Today I wanted to talk to you about mod making. I’m assuming that you’ve never made a mod so we are going to make an easy one just to get you used to the process. In a later tutorial, I’ll show you how to check your mod after an update to make sure it still works.
From simple things such as removing the need to type in the game’s ever-expanding list of cheats, giving you an easy way to make money, add skill points, or tweak relationships, you can do it all. Fine-tune populations, limit those horrendous situational outfits NPCs spawn with, or even give NPCs a makeover – this mod is a must-have for any player.
As long as you are vigilant about following these steps every time the game gets an update, you should have very little trouble with your mods at all. Almost all cases of mod problems come down to user error. We hope this guide will cut down on a lot of that and help you mod your game without any serious issues.
Once you're in game, you'll also need to enable mods in your game settings by going to your Options menu under the Other tab. Make sure to check off "Enable Custom Content and Mods" and "Script Mods Allowed" depending on what you've chosen to install. You'll need to restart your game afterwards.
If you just start dumping hundreds and thousands of .package and .ts4script files into your Mods folder, things are going to get messy fast. Pretty soon, you won’t have any idea where to look to find a broken piece of CC or an outdated mod. You can avoid this by organizing your mods and CC into subfolders. You can organise your content in any way that makes sense to you, but make sure you don’t go more than one or two subfolders deep. The game can’t read files that are buried too far into the Mods folder. Many players like to organise their downloads by creator or by the website they got them from.
Problems with mods spike every time the game gets a new patch. This is because patches almost always break mods and many players don’t realise that they have to update their mods after a patch before they can play their game again. Here is the standard procedure to follow when the game gets an update if you are a mod user:
A note on updating outdated mods: Most modders don’t want you to do that. I suggest sending them a note and asking. If you have not heard back in a reasonable amount of time (weeks) then go ahead and do the update but make sure you state that it is NOT YOUR mod and that you will remove it if the original creator objects. Link to the original mod. I have many mods (40 to be exact) that I have updated for my own personal use and won’t share because I didn’t make them.
