This is a mod for The Sims 4 that adds 70+ cheats to the game, such as editing family trees, adopting pets and other Sims into family trees, recognition of extended family members, adjusting Sim info such as adding diplomas to Sims, changing weather events, directly switching between households without going to world management, shortcuts for build and CAS cheats, and so much more. Everything in this mod is very useful for setting up your Sims, families, save files, gameplay, etc.
Many of the best Sims 4 mods affect the ways Sims interact with each other. The Sims 4 has a long list of traits that change the way a Sim behaves, and because they’re relatively easy for modders to create you can quickly expand that list through custom content.
With this mod, your sim will get the option to work from home. Giving them the following tasks: 1. Babysit Children and Toddlers, 2. Throw Babysitting Job Event, 3. Send Parents text, 4. Read to a Toddler, 5. Help a Child or Teen with Homework, 6. Bathe a Toddler. Another fun thing about this is that sims with a psychology degree will jump into the Good Guardian Level. Now, we for one cannot wait to try this mod out. And, if you feel the same way, we suggest you give it a download by clicking on this button.
Simmers have been begging for better base game babies for years, but in the meantime modder Caradriel has given us lots more to do with our tiniest Sims. Bear in mind that this mod does require the Parenthood Stuff Pack DLC. Once you've got both, the Better Babies mod gives you all sorts of new moodlets and conversation topics related to raising tiny Sims.

Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
This Sims 4 mod is all about adding more complexity to character romance and interactions, letting you tweak the traits they find attractice in others, dating preferences, and even attitude towards birth control. Wonderful Whims adds a whole extra layer to the Sims 4 dating experience, giving it a little extra depth and less superficiality.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
Have looked into the mods listed but wonder if you could help with advice. I’m having issues running sims 4 so going back to 2 for now, i would like to do a baby challenge save on sims 2 and i’m looking for something to help with relationships. In the sims 4 you can download a mod called ‘Simda’ and its a chatroom you can access that builds up the romance to then woohoo for baby. Do you know of a similar way i can do this in the sims 2 at all?

## Better nanny mod alters game data so that sims are more behaved.

This mod adds a new Teen/Elder Babysitter job, and Sims employed in this job will now show up to work when you hire a nanny. If no Sims are available, it will generate a few teen townies to fill the role. In addition, the Nanny Service was completely rewritten from the ground up, so these should do a better job and annoying behavior such as the baby bottle spam should not be a thing anymore.
This mod adds more after school programs for children and teens which will allow them to participate in more sports and more clubs. Each program will help sims make friends, maintain friendships, build skills, motives, and character values. Your children will also be able to get some or all of their homework done it depends on what program they join.
Enthusiasm Overhaul – The mods improves the hobby enthusiasm system, better matching hobbies to interests, makes the One True hobby more important than others, decay is dependent on interests, stops annoying hobby messages and more. Also includes a mod that prevents sims gaining cuisine enthusiasm for every meal they eat.
Though this mod really is a simple fix to a little annoyance in the game, it really does the job. We know for a fact, that a lot of simmers have been complaining about having their toddlers return home cranky after daycare. But with this mod that will no longer be an issue. So, even though this is nothing fancy, and really is the bare minimum we need in the game… We are very grateful to PHAERIIA for making it!
Sims can practice a wide variety of skills to help advance them through their careers, fulfil their aspirations, and generally make day-to-day life easier and more rewarding. You can use the following cheat to set a Sim's proficiency level in any skill:
All of the new moodlets and associations that come with unusual relationships really makes the game more compelling. If your sim’s relationship stays stagnant or slowly lowers, your sim will become bored! The detail and little additions in this mod really make the game more engaging.
In The Sims 4, nannies or babysitters were not initially present in the base game, but were added in an update released on July 14, 2016. Nannies are random young adult, adult, or elder townies that will come take care of the baby/toddler/child when a Sim calls for the service, and can be male or female. Prior to this update, babies would automatically be sent to daycare when all other Sims had left the lot. Children can be left alone with babies, but cannot effectively meet a baby's needs. Now, when the last Sim leaves the lot the player will get a popup giving them the option to either hire a babysitter or send the baby/toddler to daycare, which is free but doesn't allow for toddler skill building. When nannies were first released in a patch, there was a glitch that would cause Sims introduced to the nanny to stop aging. This has been fixed in a later patch.
If you’re looking to change the game even more, have a proper dig into the Create a Sim ‘custom gender settings’ in the base game. They were updated a while back and now provide you with more options, such as the ability to allow same-sex couples to fall pregnant.
