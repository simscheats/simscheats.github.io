When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.

After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
If you want to browse through some mods without having to visit and access a tonne of websites then we recommend taking a look at these sites that curate and host mods and custom content :. Mod The Sims hosts a huge amount of mods for The Sims 2, 3, and 4 .. Once you have the mod file downloaded it should be copied into the mods folder.. "Enable Custom Content and Mods" - This enables all custom content and non-script mods.. Every time a new patch is released it can break your mods and cause issues since mods alter the game code in the same way patches do.. The best way to ensure your mods are up to date is to check the page you got the mod from and look for either an update or confirmation that the mod is fine.

The Mods FolderNext, find or create the Mods folder. It should already be there, but if it's not you can right click in the white area within The Sims 4 folder and create a folder, being sure to name it Mods. The game automatically recognizes and attempts to utilize anything in this folder. So, once we download CC, we'll copy the files to that folder. Tip: You can have other folders inside the Mods folder, so if you'd like to separate out your CC and Mods in to separate folders, or even categorize them by object/clothing type, you can do so! Additionally, Forum member RandyH notes that it's possible to rename mods so long as you keep the .package at the end of the file name. This can make your organization even simpler, and possibly help you track things down easier. All of this is actually a good idea should you run into a mod or piece of CC that gives you trouble, so that it's easier to find and remove.
The Sims 4 client will only go one-level deep when looking for script mods. In the screenshot above, you’ll see that the “McCmdCenter” file is in the very first level of the Mods folder. If you don’t do this correctly, script mods will not appear in your game.
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
Make sure that anything with a script file is no more than one level deep in the Sims 4 mod folder structure. The Sims 4 will only go one-level deep when looking for script mods. Also, go to your game options and make sure script mods and custom content are enabled, then restart your game.... view details ›

## How to create, edit, and delete sims 4 mod folders.

If your mods are not functioning properly in Sims 4, there are some free tools created by the modding community that will help you find and delete the files. The process can be tedious, but the best way is using Sims 4 Studio (a free tool for making custom content) and Sims 4 Tray Importer.
Step 1 - create the new location: copy your Mods directory (or whichever directory you wish) to your desired location. Just remember the file path to your new Mods location. When I was done copying, I had the following file path structure: "E:\Sims 4 Mods\Mods"
or instead you can copy your mods folder to your desk top to make a copy and then delete the mods folder that is in your Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4. Do not delete the copy you put on your desktop or you will lose all of your mods and custom content.
To install Sims 4 mods, you can drag and drop the mod folders you've downloaded into your Sims 4 "Mods" folder. The game should automatically have created one for you after you start up the game for the first time. Your mods folder is located in: Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.... read more ›
After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4 .. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled.. This mostly goes for people who don’t have folders within the Mods folder yet or have made folders, but there’s nothing in them.. Locate the downloaded files on your computer and then move the files manually to The Sims 4 Mods folder.. In the Mods folder, create a Mods Tutorial (any name will suffice) subfolder and move all of the “.package” files from the downloads folder into the Mods Tutorial folder.. will be stored in the “CAS” folder, Build/Buy CC should go in the “Build Buy Mods” folder, and so on.. Also, by putting newly downloaded mods in a separate folder, you can launch the game and decide whether or not you like the new mods you’ve downloaded.. If you’re having trouble finding the custom content you’ve downloaded, click the small arrow next to “Feminine,” click content, and check the box next to “Custom Content” so that the hair section shows only custom content you’ve downloaded.. One popular script mod is The Sims 4 MC Command Center Mod created by the user, Deaderpool.. We’ve already gone over how to turn on script mods, but where do you place the MC Command Center mod in the Mods folder?. First, make sure the modules and packages are placed into the same folder and that the folder is no more than one level deep in The Sims 4 mod folder structure.
Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
Sims 4 doesn't work well with more than 1 level of sub folder in mods. You can edit the 'resource.cfg' file to recognize more levels by opening and editing it with notepad. It is generally easier to just have lots of folders under mods instead. Eg mods/female hair/*.package, mods/male hair/*.package.
Next, launch The Sims 4. Now ask yourself, “What mods do I want to discard?” To figure out which mods you want to keep from these packs, find an empty lot on the world menu and select “Build.” It can be any empty lot. Once loaded into your empty lot, start placing the custom content onto the lot.
