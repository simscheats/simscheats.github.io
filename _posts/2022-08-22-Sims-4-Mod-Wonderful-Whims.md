## Sims 4 mod wonderful whims allows players to control their sims’ whims, altering their moods and behaviors in various ways.

This Sims 4 mod is all about adding more complexity to character romance and interactions, letting you tweak the traits they find attractice in others, dating preferences, and even attitude towards birth control. Wonderful Whims adds a whole extra layer to the Sims 4 dating experience, giving it a little extra depth and less superficiality.

WonderfulWhims is a standalone mod that offers plenty of social, relationship, and pregnancy enhancements in forms of Attractiveness, Impressions, Personality Archetypes, Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control and many more.Do you want your Sims to have a fully featured Menstrual Cycle? Or use Birth Control for WooHoo? Maybe you want them to be attracted to certain things or recognize personality? Try WonderfulWhims!
Many of the best Sims 4 mods affect the ways Sims interact with each other. The Sims 4 has a long list of traits that change the way a Sim behaves, and because they’re relatively easy for modders to create you can quickly expand that list through custom content.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.

Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
There are also lots of automatic settings geared towards letting non-controlled Sims live full lives without you, getting married and having babies of their own volition, and you can also use the mod to adjust the in-game time settings so your Sims don’t take half a day to shower and have breakfast. If you only grab one mod, make it this one.
However, the mod also introduces further elaboration into more explicit content, and some players are hesitant about including such detailed sexual content into their Sims games. TURBODRIVER's Wonderful Whims mod is a great best-of-both-worlds alternative. It adds many of these same systems to the game, but without the extensive mature content. The best part? Everything is adjustable, from your character's physical preferences to the extent of your Sim's autonomy and influence on each other. This mod adds so much life to the game, with these being some of the mod's best features.
Updated October 27, 2021 by Tanya Leung: Electronic Arts recently introduced Sentiments, Likes and Dislikes, and Sim Profiles, all of which further enhance the social and romantic aspects of the popular simulation game. As the demand for higher immersion arises, the Wonderful Whims mod allows for both new and old players to dive deeper into their Sims' friendships and relationships.

## This mod is a fun way to change the way your sims play.

This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
With this mod, your Sims can now become monarchs (kings and queens). They will have royal advisors and heirs, and they’ll be surrounded by the nobility. You can also enforce taxes upon the land and rule over your subjects. All in all, it’s such a refreshing experience that I recommend to everyone!
And if you’re a total beginner in Sims 4 and you don’t know how to download and install mods, I’ll include a quick guide down below. But make sure to check my general Mods and CC guide for a detailed look into adding mods and custom content to the game.
With this mod, your Sims kids will stop being pushovers and actually become a bit more dangerous. They will turn into demonic toddlers the second you let your guard down. This mod makes life in the Sims 4 a lot more exciting. You can’t control them, but you can protect yourself. They will now be able to set things on fire, pick up deadly weapons and use them to attack anyone they see. Check it out here.
The first amazing thing that this mod adds is a relationship attractiveness system where your sims will actually have different perceptions of sims based on their own preferences. They’ll have first impressions of sims and can even be in polyamorous relationships.
Say goodbye to generic, meaningless conversations and hello to meaningful, engaging chats with this mod for the Sims 4! As a fan of the Sims 4 who’s tired of seeing their storyless Sim friends chatting about nothing, this mod was made for you. You will be giving them some personality with this mod and never experience any more mundane conversations again. Install it from this page.
With this mod installed, you'll notice that 'idle chat' has been totally removed, with Sims being forced to have meaningful interactions instead of filler at every opportunity. Using their traits and moods and other pointers, the game will find things for Sims to talk about whenever they interact.
With this mod, you’ll be able to control and play with your pet in Sims 4 as if it was a human Sim. You’ll be able to go wherever you want with them, run around, play, and misbehave. You’ll also need to take care of your needs just like you would on any other Sim.
