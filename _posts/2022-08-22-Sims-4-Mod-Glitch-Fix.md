## Sims 4 mod glitch - how to fix it?

@avaler06Unfortunately, it looks that some files in your game folder are corrupted and because fixing the game applies only to the instalation folder you need to replace these files with new ones.Step 1. Rename The Sims4 folder to "The Sims4 old"Step 2. Turn on the game - a new game folder will be created and you will have two - one old, one newStep 3. Check if you still have this problem in the newly created game folder. Start a new game with random sims and play by 5 minutes.If the problem disappearedStep 4. Delete in the new game folder following folders:"saves" and Tray.Step 5. Go to "The Sims 4 old" folder and copy - your "saves " folder.Step. 6. Paste this folder in a newly created game folder.Step 7. Do the same with Tray folder and TrayDeleteItems fileStep 8. Check if there are newly updated version mods you are using.Then copy and paste your mods and CC from the old mods folder to the new one. First copy the scripts mods every time checking if the game is working properly. If you have a lot of CC try 50/50 method ( divide your CC into smaller batches for example 50 pieces in one subfolder and check these subfolders one by one)Step. 9. Launch the game and check if this problem also disappeared in this old save. However, it may happen that although the new saves will not have this error anymore, the old save will remain damaged.The last step - delete The Sims4 old folder.Your saves and library will be not changed or damaged

@GGsimxs , it might be! CC and Mods can become outdated anytime there is an update/patch to the game. If any of your CC or Mods are outdated, you will need to find the outdated items and see if the creator has updated them to be compatible with the newest game update. In order to see if this problem is caused by your CC, please do all of the following steps:1) Move the Mods Folder to your desktop2) Delete the localthumbcache.package file in the game folder. This is important because it can contain bits of corrupted data even after you remove your CC/Mods! This is found in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4. 3) Fix you game in Origin by logging in and go to Library, then right-click on The Sims 4 and choose the "Repair Game" option from the list. Wait until Origin finishes repairing all your packs and not just the base game.4) Now, when you turn on your game again, it will create a new mods folder that will be empty. Check to see if your game is now working without mods/CC.5) Now you can try adding back items from your Mods folder one at a time checking your game each time to see which item is causing your game to not work properly. If you have a lot of items, you can try the 50/50 Method, working in batches to see which CC item or Mod is the culprit. (You could have multiple items causing problems.)The CC creators will usually update the CC items and Mods after these updates, so when you find out which one is the culprit, you can get the updated version from whoever made that item of CC in the first place. You should try these steps anytime you have problems in your game to rule out CC/Mods problems. It is the responsibility of the Mods/CC creators to update their items anytime EA releases a patch/update, and it is the responsibility of the people who use Mods/CC to make sure they are using the most recent version. When you find the updated version of your CC items, you can put them back into your game. Please update us on your situation!
I'm not a Mac user, so if this doesn't work, you may want to post about your issue on the Mac Board: https://answers.ea.com/t5/The-Sims-Mac/bd-p/The-Sims-MacIt sounds like you may have some outdated mods/cc. If that's the case you might try taking your Mods folder out from the Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4 and move them to the desktop or some where else safe, and try the game again.Delete the localthumbcache.package from the Sims 4 folder. This helps clear up some game glitches and will help to make sure there isn't any issues with any mods or cc. Like mods/cc that are outdated or no longer in game.If the game runs well without the mods folder. This most likely means that it is outdated mod or cc. This can happen as we get updates for the games, some mods and custom content become outdated. You'll need to to go through your mods folder to find what needs to be replaced.Finding Problem Mods and CChttp://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:TS4_Finding_Problem_Custom_Content
Moved, and merged with another thread about the same Hi @thequeenofsnails,As @AB_928Z was suggesting, there seems to be an issue with one of the mods you downloaded. The error message is telling you the file causing the problem is: C:\Users\Owner\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods\[smubuh] BodysuitPt1\MACOOSX\._[smubuh]AuroraBodysuitFull.packageOpen that folder and remove the file - then try again Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions, and welcome to the forums!-Mai

Developers of The Sims reached out through The Sims Twitter on July 27. They stated they were investigating the issue and would be working to fix it. We would not get our hopes up for an immediate fix as these normally take time. Just because a company identifies a problem does not mean it will have a solution quickly; bug fixes typically do not happen overnight.
I started getting mods for clothes and furniture for the sims 4. They worked out fine, it made the game a little glitchy but other than that everything was okay. But then I started getting script mods (extreme violence, inteen, etc.) It seemed fine and it said that it was working when I started up the game. The game opened fine, I could create characters and do other things at a decent speed. But when I tried to play a household, the picture for the family glitched with a blue color and whenever I pressed the play button, it didn’t do anything. I’ve done everything I could- I’ve cleaned out my mods, restarted the game over a million times, I even removed the script mods and turned them off (normal mods too) and it still didn’t work. I’ve tried everything I can think of and I made this account specifically for this reason. No one on the internet that I can find seems to be having the same problem, so do I have a virus or a problem that only my computer has? If any of you have had the same problem or had a solution, please let me know. Thanks!
Last night I played the Sims 4. It ran normally, no glitches, and it didn't crash or freak out or anything. This morning, after getting some new CC, I eagerly hit "Play" on origin, only for it to send me a message like this:Unable to start:Cannot start because the below file appears to be corrupted.If this file is a mod please remove it and try again. If not, please repair or reinstall the game via Origin.C:\Users\Owner\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods\[smubuh] BodysuitPt1\MACOOSX\._[smubuh]AuroraBodysuitFull.packageSo I did some googling, and I repaired the game. The same thing happened again. I backed up my game saves to a flash drive, I reinstalled, and it happened again! I'm getting frustrated and really bored as well, lol. What can I do? Did I save it weird (sorry if I'm coming off as really dumb because the file name CONTAINS a name of some cc I downloaded, I'm not really computer-savvy.)I'll appreciate any help that I can get! Thanks!
This only affects you if your aging slider is set to short, long, or custom. If you have the default aging slide or the normal slider, you won’t have to worry about your Sims suddenly aging. If you already have the slider set to another level, then you’ve got the glitch, and changing it won’t fix things.

I go to play the Sims last night after going CC shopping and when I hit play on origin, it told me the file was corrupted and I needed to repair or reinstall. The repair button wasn’t working, but will I loose all data and game saves if I reinstall it? And how to I reinstall? And my packs, will I have to pay for those again?
