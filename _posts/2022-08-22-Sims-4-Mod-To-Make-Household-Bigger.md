## Create a household with more than 4 sims.

If there is a way to break the barrier of the 8 Sims, but remember that the more members you have, the more difficult the game will be, since you have to take care of the needs and objectives of each of them. To make this work you need to use a mod known by the name of "Full House Mod" that can be downloaded from the official website of the creator . Just in case you're wondering, Electronic Arts officially allows mods to be used in The Sims 4, although it clarifies that these are used under the responsibility of the users . However, the Full House Mod has been used by many players and is fully functional while keeping the game's performance in top condition.

In Sims 4, we have the freedom to create as many families as we want. We can find them peaceful neighborhoods, build them cozy homes, and even send them on vacations. But we can’t always create the ideal family for ourselves, simply because of one silly rule – the household number limit! And the only way to remove the household limit in Sims 4 is to use a mod!
This Sims 4 mod lets you have up to 24 Sims in one house, which is your new household limit. However, we’ve found that 24 is enough for almost all types of gameplay, so it shouldn’t be much of a problem. And the reason why the creator has included this rule is just to make sure that our systems can run the game with so many Sims active in one place without crushing.
When it comes to the number of Sims in a world, that is to say at a general level in all the worlds, you can create all the families you want in The Sims 4, although respecting the rule of 8 maximum characters in each one of them.

There is a way to have more Sims than the game normally allows, and in our complete guide to The Sims 4 we will explain how to do it.
