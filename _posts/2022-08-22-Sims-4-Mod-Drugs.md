## Create mods for the sims 4.

To add the mod to your Sims 4 game, you'll need to go to the Basemental Drugs Mod page and Download the ZIP file. You'll also need the Universal Venue List mod, which is a simple file that pairs with the mod to maintain venue stability. It is not a script file and can be placed in the same folder as your Basemental Drugs Mod, so it will be unobtrusive.

After you download the necessary files, drag them into the Mods folder within your The Sims 4 PC files. Create a new folder with whatever name you want (we chose Basemental Drugs for clarity), and stick all of the files in the folder. Do not stick the files in any folder deeper than the Basemental Drugs one, as it will not show up in the game.
The Basemental Drugs mod for The Sims 4 is an adult-oriented illegal drug-use mod that adds to gameplay. The mod is not suitable for minors or those who may find reckless drug use triggering or offensive. With the mod, sims in the game have the ability to use illegal drugs in a recreational manner, whether it be teens or elders. While the mod can appear to glorify drug use, sims will have negative effects from drug use and have to deal with addiction, rehabilitation, and even death.
The sims 4 drug mod allows you to have a plethora of narcotics like MDMA, ecstasy, coke, which you cannot experience in real life (and you shouldn’t’!) In addition to this, you’ll be able to encounter a hangover, drug addiction, grow weed, become a dealer and various drug-related escapades.
The end result is one of the most realistic Sims 4 mods. From overhauling the attraction system to adding a bunch of risqué animations and the like — Wicked Whims is the perfect mod for Sims players who want their romantic ventures in the game to venture into the extreme.

This mod is one that changes the way Create a Sim works. While it's already possible to change just about everything about your Sim's physical appearance (including the size of their feet!), the one thing that we can't change is your Sim's height. Because of this, every Sim is the exact same height.
"Basemental Mods" is a well-known pairing of mods, "Basemental Drugs" and its add-on "Basemental Gangs," that add actions and interactions featuring drugs, alcohol, and gangs, among other things, to The Sims 4. While "Basemental Drugs" requires only the base game to work, "Basemental Gangs" requires both the former mod, as well as Get To Work, to function. Both mods can be downloaded here.
The most prominent feature of the mod is its range of drugs for sims to experiment with. The list includes cannabis (weed), tobacco, cocaine, amphetamine, shrooms, MDMA, ayahuasca, xanax, lean, adderall, LSD, and steroids. The mod also includes edits to mixology that adds new drink recipes, as well as the ability for sims to become drunk, and even alcoholics. The drugs are acquired in differing and semi-realistic ways, with not all being available for purchase in buy mode. The only drugs available in buy mode are cocaine, amphetamine, MDMA, and tobacco. Cannabis seeds are included for gardening (incorrectly categorized in Indoor Plants, rather than with the other seed packets in Outdoor Activities), as well as rolling papers, weed curing jars, and bongs. Drugs can form addictions (which will result in an addiction moodlet for the affected sim), and repeated use of drugs in a short period of time can result in a sim's death by overdose. If WickedWhims is installed, sims can pay dealers for drugs with sex. A sim or household that frequently sells drugs may be subject to police busts or swat raids, in which they will be taken to jail and have their inventory items confiscated.
There's a mod called Wicked Whims that is pretty adult-themed but has a fair share of great tweaks that makes each sim in The Sims 4 all the more believable. Players who just want the family-friendly content present in this game should check out Wonderful Whims instead.

## Use mods to improve the game.

This mod isn't one that just makes your game slightly more realistic, it also helps to make your game a lot more fun. Currently, Sims take quite a while to do just about anything. But with this mod, at least one part of their life is sped up dramatically.
While this is a completely aesthetic mod, it's still definitely a fun and unique one that can change your gameplay up and make your game a lot more realistic. This mod will allow you to make your Sims taller or shorter, making it a lot more realistic than having everyone be the exact same height.
Sometimes, when the game is patched, the mod will cause all doors on every lot to disappear, making it impossible for sims to enter their house or travel between rooms. Purchasing a door will cause it to disappear again. This can be ameliorated by turning off the mod, using cheats to teleport sims (or automatically fill their needs if that is the main goal), or waiting for the mod to be updated.
While the game has a ton of content for players, there are some players that still like to get a little more out of their game. Luckily, the Sims community is full of talented people that create custom hairstyles, clothing, furniture, and even gameplay tweaks. Some of these are just for cosmetic purposes, some add silly fun, and some make your game even more realistic.
Basemental is doing his best to release a new mod version on the start of each month. However, if there is a new game patch out, Basemental will sort out a hotfix for the game patch as fast as humanly possible and upload it to this page first and foremost.
Any of the Optional Packages files can be dragged into other Basemental Drugs folders if you want to add them to the game. If you want to get rid of one (like Real Drink Names), drag it into the Optional Packages folder. Make sure upon launching the game that you have Script Mods and Custom Content/Mods enabled within the Game Options and Other section of settings.
You gain instant access to all new changes and improvements to my mod, including access to the most recent in-development version of Basemental Drugs. I don't have any additional rewards to offer, so this is completely optional on your part, but I am of course ridiculously grateful for the support!
The animations have bongs, papers, blunts, and other realistic props. You can either produce your food or drugs or purchase them from someone with a ‘dealer trait.’ This article will cover everything related to Basemental Drug Mod, including how to install it. We will also tell you how to use a few useful cheat for Basemental Drugs.
