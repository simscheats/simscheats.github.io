## Find and download mods for sims 4.

Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.

Sims 4 Downloads - A site that watches blogs, MTS, and TSR to watch for new CC and Mods. Basically a Sims 4 downloads news feed that can help you get to some great content. You can browse by creator using their drop-down box and discover talented artists.
That’s everything you need to know about Sims 4 custom content. If you’re looking for general Sims 4 mods, we’ve got an excellent guide for that. We’ve also got a Sims 4 cheats list if you’re looking for some help running your sim’s lives. Failing that, why not read up on what we want from The Sims 5, should Maxis decide to give us another iteration.
Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.

Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
About Mods and Custom ContentMods and Custom Content are wildly popular among Sims 4 players, but if you're new to the franchise you may be unaware what treasures await those who ravenously scour the web for the latest downloads. There is far more free content available to download than is included in the base game and all game/stuff packs combined. In this guide, I'll teach you how to install CC and mods, explain what they are and offer some direction on where to go from here by providing links to sites where you can binge-download CC for your game.
We’re several years into the Sims 4’s life cycle and the Sims 4 CC community has plugged an awful lot of content gaps. There are thousands of ways to tweak how your Sims look, what furniture you can cram into their homes, and even alter what recipes, activities, and lifestyles are available. It can feel a bit daunting knowing where to start with Sims 4 custom content, so we’ve created a one-stop shop to tell you everything you need to know, including how to install, and where to find Sims 4 CC online.
Want to know how to install Sims 4 CC? The Sims has enjoyed an incredibly active mod community since its first iteration way back in 2000. This is a series about simulating whatever you can imagine, and the Sims’ modding community has always been there to fill the gaps left by Maxis to ensure that statement really is possible.

## Use cheat codes to get around game mechanics.

Since the game's infancy, the Sims has always offered cheat codes to enhance gameplay and give players helpful bonuses. There's a cheat or a mod for almost everything; however, mods are a bit more complicated, even though the right ones can make for incredibly realistic gameplay. If you're not in the mood for downloading and meticulously organizing a bunch of files needed to make a mod, it's best to stick with good old cheat codes.
These are the most used money cheats in the game because they are so easy to use. To use these you’ll want to enable your sims 4 cheats and then type in one of these words and hit enter. Once you hit enter the game will automatically give you the amount of money you asked for.
There are no risks associated with using Sims 4 cheats as long as you enter the cheat codes correctly. However, if you enter a cheat code incorrectly, it could cause your game to crash or malfunction. It is also important to note that some cheat codes can only be used once per game session.
Some cheats that you’ve comfortably used in the past may simply not work today. The game gets updated regularly and new packs arrive all the time. So, the developers may sometimes remove a cheat or two if they think that it’s potentially harmful to the game. This was the case with the cheat to remove buffs, but the community found a solution around it!
When you are playing The Sims 4 on either Xbox or Playstation, you also have access to cheats. In order to enable cheats for a console player you need to hold down all four triggers on your controller until a small, thin white box appears in the top left hand corner where you will input your cheats.
One of the most important Sims 4 cheat codes to enter is testingcheats true, which enables additional cheats and allows you to shift-click on Sims, items etc to reveal further cheat options. To shift-click on consoles, press X+O (PS4) or A+B (XBO) at the same time.
EA makes it pretty easy to cheat in The Sims 4 with there being cheats for just about everything out there. There are money cheats, promotion cheats, skill cheats, and so much more. There are honestly hundred of different sims 4 cheats that you may need to improve your storylines and gameplay.
There is a simple cheat to be able to unlock these items that changes depending on the pack that the items come from. However, the beginning of the cheat code starts the same and that is cas.unlockbytag and then you’ll need to know the game code for each pack that this works for.
