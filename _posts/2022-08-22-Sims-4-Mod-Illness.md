## Sims 4 mod illness – a guide

This Sims 4 terminal illness mod can cause your player a fatal illness, from which they must undergo certain surgeries. These surgeries have a 20% possibility to be a successful operation. Also, ignoring the disease might drain up your Sim’s life to death.

Please note that these may not perfectly portray real mental disorders and are made to add a layer of depth to The Sims 4 that you can’t get in the base game. A Sim can be misdiagnosed in the game, something that commonly happens in real life, and the mod helps to show just how much of a toll mental disorders can take on someone’s everyday life, especially when they are not able to get the help or support they need.
The Sims 4 has a rather robust mod community, and you can find just about any type of content you want by doing a quick Google search. One of the more popular mods is the Mental Health mod, as it adds in a realistic layer of problems for Sims to deal with. Installing the mod is rather easy and can be done by following a few simple steps.
Sims can get ill in the regular Sims 4 gameplay, but the Slice of Life mod update makes sick Sims more relatable and the sickness truer to life. With this mod, your Sims can have headaches and catch illnesses such as colds, flu, stomach bugs, and WTD infection. They can pass such sicknesses even to non-playable Sims.
You will need to download the XML Injector and the Ability to Read mod. You should also go ahead and add in the Hormone Replacement Therapy mod so that you can use the full range of features. After you have everything downloaded, simply follow the instructions and place the files you need into the mods folder. After this is done, you should be able to boot up The Sims 4 and have the mod running.

Mods can be a lot of fun to use & I have quite a few of them but they do require some special precautions.Be aware that outdated mods can break your game even without viruses. If you are going to use them, my advice is to only add a few at a time and keep careful notes on which ones you are adding and where you found them. This will make it easier to check for updates later on.After adding a mod, keep an eye out for anything that looks wrong in your game. If something looks wrong, stop playing and do not save. Immediately go back and delete the mod from your Mods folder and then delete the localthumbcache.package file from your Sims 4 folder (this is very important). In fact, you should delete that localthumbcache file every time you make any change to your Mods folder. No worries, the game will auto-generate a new cache file the next time you launch Sims 4.Also keep an eye out for Last Exceptions files in your Sims 4 folder as they can be a good indicator that you are using an outdated mod & it is causing script errors.Finally, make sure you temporarily remove all mods and CC prior to installing a game patch. This means you'll want to make sure that the "Automatic game updates" setting is disabled in Origin to allow you the chance to move out the mods before the patch downloads. Keep in mind that just because a mod has been working fine for a long time, it does not automatically mean it will still work after a game patch. Always check for mod updates after installing a game patch.There are a couple of broken mod/CC trackers that I use. One tracker is on the Sims 4 Forum that is posted by luthienrising:https://forums.thesims.com/en_US/discussion/968717/broken-updated-mods-cc-university-editionThe other tracker I use is on a site called Simsonic Sims:https://simsonic.weebly.com/mods.htmlIf all this sounds like a lot of work, well maybe it is, but it is nothing compared with trying troubleshoot and fix a game after it has been broken by an outdated mod.P.S. I usually use the sites @Psychotps mentioned :D
A deadly illness would consume your character, due to which they’d have to undergo numerous surgeries. Although these operations only have a 20% chance of survival, you don’t have any other option as doing nothing would also lead to your persona’s demise from the Sims 4 disease mod.
After you’ve successfully installed the mod into your Sims 4 game, you need to actually initiate the mod to start experiencing some tragedy. When in the game, click on your sim to open up the pie menus. There, you will see “Life Tragedies…” Click that pie menu to open up the other option, which will be “Tragedies…”
The Mental Health mod currently places in eleven different disorders for you Sims to deal with, along with two chronic disorders. With this, you also get ways to treat the disorders like medication and therapy. There is also the option to use support groups that are themed around real-life problems, like LGBTQ+ support and self-help groups. You also have the ability to help support and encourage other Sims to seek help.

## Sims 4 mod illness: causes and solutions

Illness in the sims franchise has been around for a long time and sims 4 illnesses are tons of… fun? Our sims can get sick from a variety of random causes around town and you must know how to prevent and cure these illness or your sims will be a lot less useful.
Various illnesses are introduced in The Sims 4: Get to Work, each with their own unique symptoms. Sims who are ill will receive an Uncomfortable moodlet relating to the illness. Most illnesses are not serious and are easily cured by drinking orange juice, hot tea, medicine (which can be purchased from a computer) or by napping or sleeping. None of the diseases are fatal.
Your Sims's lifestyle will greatly affect your Sims's health if you have the HEALTHCARE REDUX MOD installed, your Sims will suffer the consequences of unhealthy habits, too little activity will also affect your Sims's well-being, there are also a variety of medications and supplements available to help you keep your Sims as healthy as possible.
The best cure for all illnesses is rest. Sick Sims should be kept away from healthy Sims, and should not be standing for too long. Their comfort and energy can be kept high by making them sleep and relax on a bed, until a message appears saying they are cured. Meditation can be used to freeze these motives in order to keep them high.
Disease in the Sims franchise has been around for a long time and Sims 4 diseases are tons of ... fun? Our sims can get sick from a variety of random causes in the city and you need to know how to prevent and treat these diseases or your sims will be a lot less useful.
Nausea is a common illness that Sims can experience from a variety of causes. Affected Sims will get the "Nauseous" moodlet that lasts for 2 hours, and after the moodlet expires the affected Sim will throw up. Nausea isn't contagious or fatal and is effectively cured after the affected Sim vomits. There are several different ways for Sims to become nauseous.
In The Sims 4: Seasons, Sims have a chance of catching a cold in winter. It can be remedied by staying hydrated or taking medicine. There does not seem to be a related moodlet, but Sims will often become dizzy when they have a cold. The player is also notified when a sick Sim is cured.
In The Sims 4, Sims can experience nausea for various reasons, such as morning sickness from pregnancy or by eating spoiled food. Sims with the squeamish trait will become nauseous if they get into fights, witness death or another Sim vomiting, experience privacy violations, or do anything involving "creepy crawlies", such as fishing or searching for frogs. Vegetarian Sims also become nauseous after eating food that includes meat.
