## Sims 4 mods can be organized in any way you like.

I wanted to talk to you about organizing your Sims 4 folders. I’m one of those people who likes everything nice and tidy, including my Sims 4 folders. So, I wanted to show you how I organize my folder. This will be done in multiple articles with the first one covering the mods folder.

Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
Now you are able to go five sub-folders deep in your mods folder. I suggest that you keep all your mods on the top level and only use the sub-folders for your custom content. Many mods (especially those that are zipped) need to be on the top level. How you organize at this point is really up to you but I will show you how mine looks to give you an idea. I like to organize my folder by what it is and then the creator. So for example my path to a shoes by Madlen would look like this: C:\Users\****\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods\Custom Content\Clothing\Madlen
There are several ways you can organize your Mods folder. I like to do mine by categories, as seen in the picture above. This doesn't really do anything special during the gameplay, but it allows me to easily find content in my folders, install new content, and delete or update old content.
Sims 4 doesn't work well with more than 1 level of sub folder in mods. You can edit the 'resource.cfg' file to recognise more levels but it is generally easier to just have lots of folders under mods instead. Eg mods/female hair/*.package, mods/male hair/*.package.

Love your ideas guys! Yes I have some work to do. I used to do this for all my mods in Sims 3 but I now have a super-duper computer that can handle more than 800-900mb without drastically affecting the game, and gone just a little nuts. Thanks for all the great ideas!
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
@dunstz Here is another great article about organizing and maintaining mods and CC:https://simscommunity.info/2018/08/08/the-sims-4-how-to-ensure-a-healthy-game/2/@Psychotps I think the default number of sub-folders for .package files is 5 levels deep unless you edit your Resource.cfg file.EDIT: @Psychotps I meant to add awesome post on Mods folder organization and maintenance!

## Depth of mod folders.

As far as I know, you can have as many folders as you like in mods as long as it's only 1 layer deep. It's nesting the folders that causes problems. I think I have about 800 .package files organized into nearly 40 folders and I could still do with dividing some of it further.
Keeping with the theme of not wanting script files to be too deep in subfolders, I organize my cc such that mods are all 1 deep, in folders with named for what their source is, to make it easy to quickly go to the right folders when updating.
"Mods-MCCC"
"Mods-LittleMsSams"
"Mods-Bienchen"
"Mods-MTS"
"Mods-TFMNSA"
@UtaulA, @Bshag4lv, as far as I am aware, the "anything more than x folders deep" rule only applies to script mods. Basically, "some" script mods allegedly won't work if you go more than like 1 or 2 folders in. Everything else is fine deeper than that as long as your resource.cfg file is setup accordingly.
Q: I would like to add folders myself, is this possible?A: Absolutely! And if a mod in the end doesn’t show up, it is too deep inside the folders, always read what the creator of the mod says about the folder depth ♥ (not all creators add this as it’s not necessary)
I should do this...but the last thing I heard was anything deeper than one folder and it doesn't show up. To my benefit, I go through all 1.5 G all the time so I pretty much know what I have in my mods folder. But the organization you guys have is awesome and inspiring.
The mod folder is only the "finished product" so to speak, I have all the separate files in the same kind of folders elsewhere on my computer, it's where I save my files first and make changes and what not before I merge them and place them in my mods.
So, it�s possible to have like 20 Folders inside the mods folder?By now, I have 4 Folders inside the mods folder: Build,Buy,CAS and Game ModsI would like to categorize them, like Skins,Shoes,Bath and so on, to organize my cc more( and I have a lot cc )
The rest, I organize by broad category: CAS, BBObjects, NonScriptMods, Careers, Aspirations, Traits, Harvestables. Then, if needed, by subcategory. So in CAS, I have Clothes, Hair, Accessories, Skins, Tattoos, SkinDetails. Some of them (clothes for example) are then split by type (so for clothes, I have Tops, Bottoms, Fullbody, Shoes, Swimsuits, Sets). Then, by creator. For example: \Mods\CAS\Clothes\Fullbody\Pipco\all their fullbody cc - you can't go deeper than 5 folders here.
