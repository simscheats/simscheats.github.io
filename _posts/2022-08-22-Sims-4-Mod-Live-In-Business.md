## Create or import a sims 4 character and take them into business.

So you know how everyone’s been screaming about home businesses in The Sims 3 and The Sims 4 since EA gave us these wonderful opportunities in The Sims 2 Open For Business? Well, with a little jiggery pokery and the Get To Work Expansion Pack, you can!

So you want to run a retail business in The Sims 4? Get To Work has you covered! We recently wrote a walkthrough and glowing review of an amazing base game mod that lets you have retail businesses in your game but for console players and the not-so-mod-savvy, this walkthrough is for you! You can run your own retail business and shop at retail businesses as a customer if you own the Get To Work expansion pack.
To start your own business, you’ll first have to have an unowned retail business placed in any of your worlds. You can use one of the premade ones in Magnolia Promenade, build your own, or download a retail lot from the Gallery. Once there is an unowned retail lot available to purchase, use the cash register symbol in the bottom right of your screen in Live Mode to purchase a retail business. Make sure your Sims have the funds to purchase the business!
Once the mod is installed correctly, you’re ready to play with your own live-in businesses! The mechanics of each type of business vary a bit depending on the type of business you’re running but they all have the exact same setup process. Build or download your venue and make sure the lot type is set to Residential. This will allow your Sims to move in there. Then in the Lot Traits tab, select the type of business you wish to run.
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.

Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
I tried the live-in store because it actually functions without Get to Work and I found that pretty fascinating. It doesn’t feature the retail perks, employee management, and all that as a result but it gives your Sims a simple way to make money off objects they’ve crafted or painted and the situations you can find yourself in – like by running an at-home day care – can be pretty funny as seen in my video above. Here’s a link to her Live-In Business Mod
Of course a modder has fixed that problem. Modders always seem to come to the community’s rescue when EA falls short of expectations. LittleMsSam has a Live in Business mod that will allow your Sims to run bars, cafes, nightclubs, gyms, daycares, pet daycares, and vet clinics from home! The mod also comes with a few optional add-on packages for you to tailor the mod to your liking. It’s also integrated with LittleMsSam’s More Buyable Venues mod. Having both mods installed will add additional functionality to your live-in businesses.
Nightclubs are a little different from cafés and bars, but still very straight forward. Open the nightclub to have guests start spawning on the lot. Make sure you have bartenders and entertainers or DJs to keep the guests entertained. Your Sims can provide these services themselves or hire service Sims.

## Learn how to create and manage a sims 4 business.

That’s everything you need to know about Sims 4 custom content. If you’re looking for general Sims 4 mods, we’ve got an excellent guide for that. We’ve also got a Sims 4 cheats list if you’re looking for some help running your sim’s lives. Failing that, why not read up on what we want from The Sims 5, should Maxis decide to give us another iteration.
There’s a lot that goes into running a successful business. Your Sims will need to be chatting up customers all the time, delegating tasks to their employees, restocking and cleaning shelves, and managing prices in their store. When you first start out, it will feel overwhelming but as you gain experience as a business owner, you’ll be able to purchase business perks to make things easier on yourself.
We’re several years into the Sims 4’s life cycle and the Sims 4 CC community has plugged an awful lot of content gaps. There are thousands of ways to tweak how your Sims look, what furniture you can cram into their homes, and even alter what recipes, activities, and lifestyles are available. It can feel a bit daunting knowing where to start with Sims 4 custom content, so we’ve created a one-stop shop to tell you everything you need to know, including how to install, and where to find Sims 4 CC online.
The past month, I've spent every day tinkering The Sims 4, making quality of life improvements, gameplay changes, and new difficulty settings for the game. If you'd like to learn more about my project, visit the post on Patreon where you can download it now.
Want to know how to install Sims 4 CC? The Sims has enjoyed an incredibly active mod community since its first iteration way back in 2000. This is a series about simulating whatever you can imagine, and the Sims’ modding community has always been there to fill the gaps left by Maxis to ensure that statement really is possible.
We were very impressed with both the depth and simplicity of this mod. Not only does it allow our Sims to live properly at their business with no annoying workarounds, but it adds so many different types of businesses that aren’t even possible to own with any official DLC.
The functionality of the mod is very simple and easy to use. Very little setup is required to get it going and your customers handle themselves for the most part. We could choose how involved or detached we wanted to be with our businesses. We could have our Sims personally serving coffee at their own café or we could just hire a barista and let the money roll in while we went about our everyday business. The mechanics are both simple and versatile and all the optional add-ons allow us to customize our live-in business experience to our liking and really make it our own.
The Sims 4 completely ignores a common situation in life – having a roommate. With LMS’s roommates mod, you can have a roommate that pays rent, and is completely outside your control. This is something that players frequently want, because it adds some spice to the game. Using LMS’s Roommate Service on your Sim’s phone, you can select from a variety of roommates who will help pay the household’s bills. Here’s a link if you’re interested.
