## Find mods for sims 4.

With that in mind, here’s a collection of the best up-to-date mods for the Sims 4, from the tiny to the virtual life-changing. Make sure you read the installation instructions for each one, and check for any conflicts to make sure you’re not running two that will clash.

The best Sims 4 mods can completely change and expand your game. New ones appear all the time on ModTheSims—which has long been the go-to hub for creators—every week. There, you’ll find everything from minor tweaks (like making medicine cabinets actually dispense medicines) to complete reworks of major systems.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
We’ve mentioned simmythesim’s Get to College mod before because it fills a gap that those who played The Sims 2 and The Sims 3 will keenly feel. The mod hasn’t been updated in many years, but luckily another modder has come along and patched it up. Grab it here.
From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.

With so many impressive Sims 4 mods out there, choosing the best ones is no easy task. Some of them fix common gameplay issues, while others add more depth to your Sims' stories. Whether you're looking for more cheats or just want to turn your Sims' world into a horror movie, there's something for everyone!
And if you click on the furthermost tool in the same corner, the one labeled Open The Sims 4 “Mods” folder, you will be directed to the destination of your installed mod. Notice that if a mod isn’t checked/selected in the main list on the Mod Manger, then it won’t be shown in the folder either.
For easiest installation, I strongly urge using The Sims 4 Mod Manager by Raxdiam for a fully automatic install, or you can install manually. Since this mod contains both a script mod and XML package file, manual installation is only suggested if you are familiar with this kind of mod. See further below for manual mod installation notes.
The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!

## Manage mod development and downloads.

Right now, thanks to supporters, I am developing this mod in my free time. But, I want to make development of my mods project as my job. All of my creations are free, but I need money for life expenses. So, you can support my work by small donations on my Patreon page.
Before you start installing mods and CC, you need to locate your Mods folder. This is where you need to place your downloaded content for your game to be able to read and install it—if you put it anywhere else, it won't work. Content that ends in the .package file extension goes here.
What we mean to say is that, we think that every simmer, a newbie or a veteran, will find a lot of uses for the Mod Manager. Its main strengths are that it makes everything super simple, quick and easy to control. After a few minutes of using it, you will become a master and you will know where every mod file of yours is, whether it’s turned on or off, whether you need it or not…
The 'load' and 'unload' options essentially dictate whether the mods will be included in your game file or not. You can unload custom content at any time, which means you won't have it in your game, but you also won't lose the download if you ever wish to include it again.
We’re talking about putting everything in the right place, renamed and clear folders, the ability to turn on and off certain mods whenever you want, to put every CC you’ve ever gotten in a correct library… It is truly an invaluable tool and a real time saver!
The Mod Checker is software that scans your entire Mods folder and discovers the broken CC files automatically. It will list all of your CC and mods from your Mods folder, and it will show which of your downloads are outdated or broken. You can then go to those folders and manually delete them.
When you are done creating the category, you will quickly notice that it doesn’t appear on the main page. That is because there’s nothing in it yet! But, if you click on the “+” and add a mod or two, you will be asked if you want to store them in your newly created folder or not. If you choose to do so, the mods will be listed in that category on the main page.
As the Mod & Custom Content Manager is still in a BETA phase, it is frequently being updated and more features planned to be added going forward. Some of the features planned for the future include a way to find broken and duplicated files, custom content files used in specific households and additional filters. There are also some more technical updates to be made for the program going forward, including making the code more efficient and reducing the programs overall file size.
