Sugar Daddies and Mommies can send gifts to their Sugar Babies! It will increase their romantic relationship and also leave a chance that your Sugar Baby will show up at your house all dressed up and flirty to say thank you! (The object is not send to the Sim (the game does not allow this) it's just get destroyed after you pick it in the picker.)
Sims with Sugar Baby trait can ask Sims with Daddy or Mommy trait to became their Sugar Daddy or Mommy. For that, they need to have the bare minimum of a romantic relationship.

u need to have the bare minimum of a romantic/friendly relationship :))) Don’t forget the “traits”. It is explained in detail in the description of the mod.

'Ask for Daily Allowance' interaction will earn your Baby simoleons. You can ask every 12 hours and as long as your Daddy or Mommy is in a good mood they will grant it to you. Amount of money your Sugar Baby gets depends on the wealth of their Sugar Partner! I know everyone has their own opinion on how much money in Sims is a lot of money, but I stopped on in-game wealth distribution system, so everyone could comfortably play. There are 3 levels of wealth based on total cash Sim has: the lowest level is Sims who have less than 10000 simoleons in cash; middle level is Sims who have more than 10000 simoleons, but less than 30000; and highest level is Sims who have more than 30000 simoleons in cash.

The same rule goes for sims with Daddy/Mommy traits: they need a low romance to start Sugar Relationship with Sim with Sugar Baby trait, but high romance to start with Sim without the trait. Sims without any Sugar traits can start Sugar Relationship with Sims with Sugar traits, but they also need high romance and they can have just one Sugar Partner at a time. Sugar Babies, Daddies, and Mommies with traits can have multiple Sugar Partners, but they still can get jealous of one another. Sugar Babies, Daddies, and Mommies without any Reward traits can have only one partner at a time.
You can develop a relationship with your partner, ask to be girlfriend/boyfriend, even propose. It won’t cancel Sugar Agreement. You can stop Sugar Relationship at any time. Depending on the level of your romance and friendship you can stay friends with your partner or become enemies. For now, there are two interactions available for Sugar Babies:‘Ask for Daily Allowance’ – will earn your Baby 500 Simoleons. You can ask every 12 hours and as long as your Daddy or Mommy is in a good mood they will grant it to you. It also will increase your romance. ‘Ask for More Money’ – will be available after your Sim finished previous interaction. This will bring your Baby from 1500 to 2000 Simoleons, but will only work after you had sex with your Daddy or Mommy and they are satisfied. It can be WW sex or traditional WooHoo. If they are unsatisfied, they will refuse and you will lose a little bit of romance. At this moment there is only one interaction for Daddies and Mommies:‘Give Baby Daily Allowance’ – you will lose 500 Simoleons, but it will increase your romance.
'Check For Gifts from Your Sugar' interaction is available for Sugar Babies in Sugar Relationship with Sims not in their household. You can check for gifts every 12 hours, just click on Mailbox and pick the Partner or Partners in the Picker. Sugar Babies will get gifts more often if they have high Charisma or WW's Sexespertise skill as well as Great Kisser or Alluring trait.
