## Sims 4 mods can cause issues with the game, particularly when it comes to gameplay.

There was a universal issue in Sims 4 where at a point, the game stopped supporting mods altogether whether they were enabled or not. This caused a global outrage to players regarding the mod’s functionality and they were unable to customize their game in any way. Electronic Arts were fast to release an update that circumvented the issue. If you have an older version of Sims 4 installed, it is recommended that you follow the method below to update it to the latest build.

We have received numerous reports regarding the issue where Sims 4 mods fail to work. Either the game doesn’t pick up the mod files which you have pasted in the directory or the mod fails to initialize. We looked at several user reports and use cases to come to the conclusion that this issue occurred due to several different reasons.
Unsupported mods: Sims 4 releases updates every now and then to either introduce new features or fix bugs. The mods need to be updated by the creators during this time as well. If the mods are not updated by the creators and they conflict with the game engine mechanics, the mods will fail to load.
Mods are a major part of Sims 4, adding endless new features, from personality tweaks to unlimited money. They let you bring fantasies to life and add depth to an already extensive sandbox simulation. However, sometimes, newly downloaded mods fail to show up in the game, and consequently, don’t work.
Another thing to check is the mod compatibility with your current Sims 4 game. We came across several different cases where the mod author didn’t update the existing version of the mod to be compatible with the latest version of Sims which caused the mod to conflict and not work as expected. Navigate to the official mod website and check if the current version of the mod which you have been using is working properly in Sims 4. You can also take a look at different forums.

Hence you should navigate to the mod’s website and make sure that the mod which you downloaded is indeed that of Sims 4 and not of the earlier versions. You can easily check this by seeing the changelog or the category in which they are placed. Identify the incompatible mods and remove them.
Mods can be a lot of fun to use & I have quite a few of them but they do require some special precautions.Be aware that outdated mods can break your game even without viruses. If you are going to use them, my advice is to only add a few at a time and keep careful notes on which ones you are adding and where you found them. This will make it easier to check for updates later on.After adding a mod, keep an eye out for anything that looks wrong in your game. If something looks wrong, stop playing and do not save. Immediately go back and delete the mod from your Mods folder and then delete the localthumbcache.package file from your Sims 4 folder (this is very important). In fact, you should delete that localthumbcache file every time you make any change to your Mods folder. No worries, the game will auto-generate a new cache file the next time you launch Sims 4.Also keep an eye out for Last Exceptions files in your Sims 4 folder as they can be a good indicator that you are using an outdated mod & it is causing script errors.Finally, make sure you temporarily remove all mods and CC prior to installing a game patch. This means you'll want to make sure that the "Automatic game updates" setting is disabled in Origin to allow you the chance to move out the mods before the patch downloads. Keep in mind that just because a mod has been working fine for a long time, it does not automatically mean it will still work after a game patch. Always check for mod updates after installing a game patch.There are a couple of broken mod/CC trackers that I use. One tracker is on the Sims 4 Forum that is posted by luthienrising:https://forums.thesims.com/en_US/discussion/968717/broken-updated-mods-cc-university-editionThe other tracker I use is on a site called Simsonic Sims:https://simsonic.weebly.com/mods.htmlIf all this sounds like a lot of work, well maybe it is, but it is nothing compared with trying troubleshoot and fix a game after it has been broken by an outdated mod.P.S. I usually use the sites @Psychotps mentioned :D
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
Corrupt current gameplay: Sims 4 allows users to create several different households. We came across some cases where the household itself was corrupt and it failed to load any new mods. Loading a new household and checking there will confirm the situation.

## Mod creators should take precautions to avoid causing problems.

As long as you are vigilant about following these steps every time the game gets an update, you should have very little trouble with your mods at all. Almost all cases of mod problems come down to user error. We hope this guide will cut down on a lot of that and help you mod your game without any serious issues.
Bad mods: If there are any corrupt or bad mods in your mods directory, there is a possibility that the entire batch of mods will not work. Here we have to apply a technique where we test each mod one by one to find the culprit and disregard it from the folder.
The number one thing you need to know about mods is that they break. They break a LOT. After almost every single game update, in fact. This means that you’ll be redownloading your mods constantly. If this sounds like too much hassle for you, then mods are probably not for you. If you are willing to keep your Mods folder maintained on a regular basis, then continue reading!
If the mod itself needs an update, make sure to leave a comment about it on its download page. However, if there is no issue with compatibility, try checking whether the mod package is unzipped. Depending on your PC operating system, the instructions for unzipping a folder differ slightly.
If the creator has announced that their mod is still compatible with the latest update, great! It’s good, you don’t need to update it. If the creator has released a new version of their mod, download the newest version and replace the old version in your Mods folder.
If the steps above don’t alleviate the issue, you may need to check the mod compatibility. This can usually be done on the mod’s download page. Make sure the downloaded mod version corresponds with your current game version and that you’ve made the necessary game updates.
Every game has a cache folder which it uses for its operations and the running of the game. Since the cache files are created at runtime and may be leftover, there are chances that some of them get corrupt. When this occurs, the game causes unexpected behavior including the mods not working as required. In this solution, we will navigate to the cache folder and clear it.
Problems with mods spike every time the game gets a new patch. This is because patches almost always break mods and many players don’t realise that they have to update their mods after a patch before they can play their game again. Here is the standard procedure to follow when the game gets an update if you are a mod user:
