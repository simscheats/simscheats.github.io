## Gametimedev provides an easy way to manage mods for the sims 4.

The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!

Anyone who uses Mods or Custom Content in The Sims 4, or even from any of previous The Sims games, will know that your Mods folder can sometimes feel a little overwhelming. However, GameTimeDev has created a program to help players keep their Mods folder organized.
Sort your mods easier. But how?Basically, you can see this tool as a file explorer with additional features, for Sims 4 files. Like any other file explorer, you can select, delete or move files. However, with this program you can also disable/enable mods/CC (individually, multiple files or entire folders), view their thumbnails and use special filters.
Sort your mods easier. But how?
Basically, you can see this tool as a file explorer with additional features, for Sims 4 files. Like any other file explorer, you can select, delete or move files. However, with this program you can also disable/enable mods/CC (individually, multiple files or entire folders), view their thumbnails and use special filters. With these filters you can first distinguish between: Create a Sim Item, Catalog/Build Mode Item or Other. In the case of Create a Sim Items, you can even differentiate more precisely into areas such as makeup, hair, shoes, etc., just like in the actual game.
This program is designed to help you bring order to your Sims 4 mod folder. It tries to extract thumbnails from the files or if that doesn't work, it searches for a thumbnail online. This is not always perfect, but helps to see what is included in a particular mod.

Of course, this is the hardest and the most troublesome way of doing this for two main reasons. First, it takes a lot of time. And second, you might end up deleting all the mods and CC that you love. And I do NOT recommend this way if you’re a total beginner in Sims 4!
The Mod & Custom Content Manager is described as a file explore with additional features which allows you to browse your files for The Sims 4 easily. You are able to delete and move files but also disable and enables files both on their own, in multiples or even whole folders. View files alongside thumbnails, which will help you distinguish content that is for Build Buy Mode or Create A Sim.
The Tray Importer is software for Sims 4 that helps you manage your CC. It actually allows you to download and upload CC and mods directly through it, which is awesome. But, it also shows you which CC files are broken/missing when you’re going over all of your CC and Mods. Then, you can either delete the broken files or find the missing pieces on the internet (it tells you the name of the missing CC files too).
