Added to The Sims 4 in an update, toddlers are the life stage during which a Sim is not quite a baby anymore but not yet a child. With their own unique skills, objects, and decorations, players are really encouraged to live out the best of the toddler life in the game and appreciate this short but rewarding time in a Sim's family life.

Promoting your toddler to a child is key to developing your Sim family as, although those little babes are cute, you don't want them to stay small forever!

By popular demand, Toddlers are now available to all Sims 4 players courtesy of The Sims Studio and EA. Toddlers have been neatly incorporated into the Sims 4 base game as though they were there from the start. They are fully animated, with skills and needs just like any other Sim, and thus fit neatly into the game as if they belonged in the first place! This time around, they have a couple more skills to level other than just walking, talking and potty. Special toddler furniture has been added to the game in order to care for and teach, so everything you need to raise them is present. Players who make a Toddler in Create-a-Sim (CAS) will find plenty of toddler clothes, facial features, and hairstyles to choose from. They even have special Toddler Traits! Let the great modding spree to add toddler clothes, toys, and furniture begin!
Toddlers were one aspect of the game that wasn't even present in the base game, which drew the ire of many fans. Thankfully, they were added in a later update for players to tinker around with the origins of a Sim from the get-go. However, raising these kids is no mean feat, and here are some things that players need to keep in mind if they wish to make the most of this life stage.

Naturally, Sim Babies will grow up to be Toddlers before 'aging up' to Child. Additionally, you can adopt Toddlers and add them to your household. Toddlers can also be made when starting a new family in CAS, unlike babies, which are made with Woohoo. This lets you make your little one as cute as you would like them to be, and give them toddler-exclusive clothes, traits, and hair styles. Remember, if you adopt a toddler, you can click them with an adult selected to change their outfit using the 'Toddler Care' menu. Toddlers have outfits of all kinds, as you would expect. The cas.fulleditmode cheat can even be used to change the look of your Toddler. Just don't mess with their traits, as that can be buggy.
Sure the descriptions of these needs make them seem very easy to care for, however Toddlers have other plans for you. They will eat up Sims' time by throwing their food away, getting enraged and crying, all of that. It's pretty realistic. Getting them through a full meal is tough, but raising skills improves their behavior so that they stop doing these things so much. Making the Toddler smart is a rewarding endeavor especially when the parent Sims are short on time.
This will give the family the chance to design their own schedule to a certain degree. It also means the child will be much more physically present in the household than before. As a result, the player will get the chance to enjoy playing with the young Sim's character more.
In order to age up your Toddler to child manually, use a grown up to bake a cake and click it to add candles for $10. When you click a cake while the Sim is holding the Toddler, the option to 'Have X Blow Out Candles' will appear - make sure to pick the option specifically with the child's name or you'd age up the adult. Depending upon how you've done at leveling up the Toddler skills, you may get one of the following traits, along with some skill experience in an equivalent child skill.

## How to teach a toddler new skills in the sims 4.

Even though they might seem a little bit confusing, the toddler skills in The Sims 4 are very easy to play with. At the start, you have a simple set of interactions that you can repeat until you unlock new ones. Then, you’ll want to repeat those until you level up again. And doing this will result in you maxing out your toddler skills in no time.
As you may have guessed, the toddler skills in The Sims 4 are Communication, Imagination, Movement, Thinking, and Potty. Each of these has 5 levels of progression, and they all require different activities and interactions. Let’s see what you can do at each level of each skill.
In The Sims 3, toddlers and children can learn up to three skill points in a skill by using certain toys. These points don't appear until the child grows into a child/teenager (depends on the skill) and attempts something related to the skill (such as cooking a meal or reading a cookbook for the cooking skill).
However, the toddler skills in The Sims 4 are often misunderstood. That’s why we’re dedicating this post to explaining all the confusion around them. We’ll tell you all you need to know about these skills, what they do, and how you can increase them efficiently. Also, know that you can skip all that by using the cheat to instantly max out skills in the game. This cheat is relatively easy to use, and we definitely recommend you to check it out.
Toddlers, like any other Sims in The Sims 4, have skills that need to be increased. These skills revolve around their development, both mental and physical. As a Sims 4 player, you need to be aware of the toddler skills if you want your child to grow up into a healthy child. That means that you’ll have to focus and work on them, along with the other things that characterize these stages.
Toddlers can also learn skills for later life by using certain toys. In The Sims 2, they can play with the rabbit head for charisma, the xylophone for creativity, and the block game for logic. Toddlers can use the activity table with the FreeTime expansion to draw or to play with blocks, allowing them to learn creativity and mechanical skills, respectively. FreeTime also allows toddlers to gain charisma by learning and singing the nursery rhyme.
Toddlers have five skills in The Sims 4: Movement, Potty, Communication, Thinking, and Imagination. All of them unlock new abilities for the growing child and change the way the AI behavior works when you are playing with full autonomy. This is nice, as you can actually see the effects of them growing more mature and learning not to throw fits and food. All but one skill (potty) has an ideal mood, which boosts the experience gained while practicing.
This guide to Toddlers in The Sims 4 will teach you everything you need to know about raising your nooboos. I'm a gameplay mechanics writer, so you won't hear about every interaction and activity. I leave discovery of those up to you, I'm focused on those that build up a skill or involve child care. Let's get started with how we can add a toddler to the game, then proceed to learning about raising them and the skill they can learn to prepare for childhood...
