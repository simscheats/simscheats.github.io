## Sims 4 mods can lead to tragic outcomes.

Some Sims 4 players may find this mod disturbing or unnecessary as people use this game for escapism. However, if you put the tragedies occurrence to very low, the mod stops being a murder-fest. At very low, the Sims 4 becomes more realistic, as bad things can happen at any time.

The Sims4modding community offers players a huge variety of ways to alter their games - for every mod meant to improve the lives of Sims, there is bound to be one about making their lives worse. Many players are always looking for new ways to torture or kill their characters in The Sims 4, a fact which many modders are keenly aware of. Whether players are looking to torture and terrorize Sims emotionally or physically, there's a mod that can help.
Letting a character in The Sims 4live a long, happy life is all well and good, but sometimes what players really want is to cause utter chaos within the game, and luckily, there are a slew of mods created just for that purpose. The practice of torturing and killing Sims has gone on before Sims 4, but without the use of mods it can sometimes be difficult for players to make their Sims miserable. Although some deaths can be triggered purposefully without much trouble, like starvation or drowning, many are random events controlled by the game. The options for physical altercations between Sims is also lacking without mods, making it difficult to start any sort of drama between Sims.
The introduction of Sims 4 Life Tragedies mod was for the sole reason of intrigue and entertainment. You can be a mere spectator in this game while murders happen all around you, or you can even be a murderer yourself and take things into your own hands. It has an uncanny resemblance to the Sims 4 kill mod.
This Sims 4 terminal illness mod can cause your player a fatal illness, from which they must undergo certain surgeries. These surgeries have a 20% possibility to be a successful operation. Also, ignoring the disease might drain up your Sim’s life to death.

This mod introduces fatal illnesses, car accidents, kidnappings, bullying and even five unique serial killer characters who will prey on the Sims. Depending on the player's settings, some events might happen more often than others, so make sure to tune the mod as soon as it's installed.
Like many PC games, the Sims 4 has a large modding community. While some mods offer primarily cosmetic changes to the game in the form of furniture or character customizations, other Sims 4 mods add new places to explore or new ways to interact with other sims. The best part is that mods like the Extreme Violence Mod are available for free.
Unexpected and dramatic things can happen in anyone's life, and it's always on the news. In The Sims 4, it's all sunshine and rainbows for the most part, unless the player has the Life Tragedies mod installed to truly alter their experience. A word of warning: this isn't for the faint of heart.
Real life is pretty brutal and if there's something that's missing in The Sims 4, it's all things crime and action. There are no weapons, no assaults, no murder in the game, and maybe for a good reason. But for those above the age of 18 who want real crime and real consequences, there's a perfect mod out there.

## Sims 4 mods can be very dangerous.

You will need to pay attention to where you are getting the mods from. There are commonly used websites such as Mod the Sims, TwistedMexi, and Sims 4 Studio. However, there are a lot of simmers who upload mods to their own blogs, GitHubs, and io pages.
The Sims 4 makes it easy for users to install mods. For Windows users, players will want to direct their downloads from the modding site to their Sims 4 Mods folder, which can be found by opening the "Documents" folder under "This PC," then opening the "Electronic Arts" folder followed by the folder for The Sims 4. Here there should be a folder labeled "Mods" - if not, players can simply create their own by right-clicking and creating a new folder. To use and install Sims 4 mods on Mac the process is almost identical, except the "Documents" folder will be found after opening the "Users" folder and selecting themselves. Players should then extract any compressed files within the folder, and be certain that no files are located more than one folder deep within the Mods folder, as the game will not be able to find these files. In order to make sure all downloaded mods will work within The Sims 4, players will need to enable mods and script mods in the game's "Options" menu.
Another classic mod from SACRIFICIAL, this mod turns toddlers into unstoppable murder and mayhem machines. With this mod, toddlers can attack adults with knives and set them on fire, as well as start blazes separately to destroy property. Adults can even team up with toddlers as criminal partners and revel in their evil deeds together. There's also an option to make toddlers attack autonomously, meaning even players won't know what the terrifying tykes will do next. Toddlers in The Sims 4 are already difficult to raise, but this mod takes it to an entirely new level and is the perfect way to terrorize any Sim.
After the file is downloaded, launch the Sims 4 game, click on the Game Options menu, and select Other. Check off the Enable Mods and Custom Content box or, if it is a script mod, then check the Enable Script Mods box. Once that is done, all that is left to do is apply the settings and start playing. For players still having issues accessing the mod, YouTuber Simming Pothead offers a step-by-step tutorial.
Is life just not hard enough for your Sims? Look no further for that extra dose of University blues than taking up one of these new skills to make extra cash. Any Sim can ask for your services and you’re free to turn them down too, but that won’t pay for your tuition will it?
Now, you can take a look at the other options on the Life Tragedies menu. In the options, you can Enable/Disable Automatic Tragedy Occurrence Options (the enabled one is blurred out because it’s already initiated for my Sim,” disable sims reactions to occurrences (they won’t receive debuffs), and you can give any Sim of your choice a bullet wound, or a fatal illness.
To install the Extreme Violence Mod, players must first create a mod folder under the Electronic Arts file on their computer. This is the main file that houses all of the Sims information. If a player has already installed mods for the Sims 4, then this folder should already exist. Once the folder is created, download the Extreme Violence Mod directly from Sacrificial Mods. Players may need to unzip the file before it is usable unless the downloaded version is a script mod. It's important to note that these files must not be in a subfolder otherwise the mod will not work.
Fatally Injured Sims can go to the Hospital. My Sim had just been shot, so they had a higher chance of being saved. When I tried to click on the option, it didn’t work. So I went into the debug menu and removed the bullet hole myself. While in the menu, I decided to make my Sim an armed robber.
