## Sims 4 mods can kill other sims, and you need to be aware of this risk.

If you ever wished to turn The Sims 4 into a true murder mod show, then you’ve come to the right place! In The Sims 4, murder can’t really happen without mods, or at least not exactly how we want it to happen. Instead, we’re forced to use mods that allow this feature. But, that won’t be a bad thing once you see how perfect this mod is!

This is an honestly wild mod that every sims player needs to try at least once in their gameplay. It isn’t for the faint of heart because the interactions are pretty gruesome and scary so you may not want to participate, it’s really up to you. Happy playing!
Well, there can be a number of different reasons why you want to play The Sims 4 with a murder mod. Most simmers go for it because they want to make the game more realistic. Violence and death are part of the real world, and Sims 4 is just a copy of that. Also, murder mods can add a tremendous amount of action to the game, which is something we lack off most of the time.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
Have you ever tried modding a Sims 4 game to have a gaggle of female sims in Victorian ball gowns stab other ball goers to death? I have and I don’t recommend it. The amount of clipping and whatever else happened to my poor integrated graphics was too much for the game to bear. It crashed and forced me to redownload all 40 gigabytes of the game.

It's not a secret that The Sims 4 has made it too difficult to kill Sims. The chances of a Sim dying by fire or drowning, for example, are not that high. It may seem weird, but some players actually want to kill a certain Sim for many reasons; either story progression, a Sim is being annoying, or a bunch of other reasons.
The mod is just as its name implies, and primarily contains different ways Sims can attack and kill each other. For Halloween times, it's the ideal mod, but to avoid any unwanted surprises of favorite Sims dying in a free for all murder spree, make sure to tune the mod before putting it into use. Otherwise, Sims will have a bad tendency to go on murder sprees as often as they get a glass of water!
Although there are ways to role play as a serial killer in The Sims 4 by simply cooking bad quality pufferfish and serving it to dinner guests, there are mods that make murder and violence ten million times easier. Well, in theory. Evil deeds don't come without consequences, as the Extreme Violence mod also introduces witnesses, jail time, and the police.
Many of the best Sims 4 mods affect the ways Sims interact with each other. The Sims 4 has a long list of traits that change the way a Sim behaves, and because they’re relatively easy for modders to create you can quickly expand that list through custom content.
