## Create a wellness mod for the sims 4.

I’d be doing an injustice for not mentioning this mod made by the lovely KawaiiStacie. In total the download includes ten mods rolled into one, all made by her. Some of the mods include menstrual cycles, getting drunk from drinking alcoholic beverages, wearing makeup or perfumes, and even allowing sims to have realistic sickness! If you don’t want all ten then I suggest heading over to her website to pick and choose the best ones for you.

If those cheat codes sound way too complicated, you can download pregnancy mods for the sims 4 to make things much easier. They’ll give you even more options for your sims’ pregnancies and much more control. Both of these mods are listed in my must-have mods for sims 4 post because they truly are mods I can’t live without!
The list of possible Sims 4 mods is basically endless. You can spend hours and hours looking through various websites, trying to find out whether a given mod is useful or just a waste of time. Over dozens of hours, we’ve tested a plethora of mods and hand-picked the ones most worthy of your attention. Through some trial and error, we’ve also listed which mods contradict each other and won’t function if both are installed at the same time.
However, if it seems like too much of a hassle to type out these long cheat codes, I’m also telling you two of my favorite sims 4 pregnancy mods. These mods will give you the ability to do everything the cheats can do, plus more, but they make it WAY simpler.
If you want to take cooking to the next level, this is the mod you want. It allows you to purchase things from your phone with a whole new “shop for” category is broken down into drinks, flowers, fish, groceries, veggies, herbs, and fruit. You can buy things like chicken nuggets, cooking oil, canned goods, and butter. It’s much more detailed than the default game ever gets. You can even stack your groceries on display in your kitchen, which is a great blend between clutter and functionality. Imagine that, usable Sims decorations. Who would have ever thought this day would come?

WooHoo Wellness mod is for the game, Sims 4 by LUMPINOU and comes in the name WoHoo Wellness
and Pregnancy Overhaul. This mod affects both partners in several ways; Pregnancy
preferences and varied reactions, WooHoo Risk, protection, fertility surgeries, WooHoo
Transmissible Diseases, Paternity testing and drama, teen pregnancy reactions, cheating
module, surrogate mothers and artificial insemination, adoption overhaul, and etc. We can
discuss the modules related to this one by one as follows.
This download makes woohooing in the Sims 4 possibly as risky as woohooing in the real world. With this mod you have the introduction to WooHoo transmitted diseases (WTDs) and a wide range of moods that affect you after contracting a WTD. You can ask other Sims about their health, take fertility tests to see if a risky woohoo can lead to a pregnancy, as well have periods!
In addition, there are four different types of belly packs you can download into your game (make sure you only download one and not all of them) and allows for 46 different types of movements usually restricted for expecting sims. This mod is one of four from LittleMsSam’s and bless her soul for all of them. She is an amazing modder who works with other folks to bring us well-rounded downloaded content and gameplay. Make sure to check out her tumblr where you can access her google drive to 168 different mods!
This is a gameplay mod that makes pregnancies more realistic in the sims 4. It really adds to sims 4 family gameplay and I absolutely love it! Just like with MC Command Center, this is a HUGE mod. It actually contains 10 different modules. These include:

## Create a sims 4 mod that improves well-being.

Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
This has made the game tenfold more fun for me. Sims emotions are much less predictable and you have to work that much harder to figure out how to make them happy. The mod includes an in-game tutorial as well as an in-game setting menu that lets you pick and choose the features you want in your game. I would recommend first going through the in-game tutorial before customizing your settings menu to get a good feel for the things you do and don’t want in your game.
If you're fed up with your Sims having meaningless chit-chats with each other, then this mod from PolarBearSims (opens in new tab) could be just the ticket to spice up their interactions. This extensive mod introduces many changes, but one of the key features is removing idle chat from conversations. This means that instead of nattering, your Sims will have to interact with each other, and the mod will decide how this goes down based on the existing relationship between the Sims, plus their character traits and current mood. Sit back and watch how things pan out, but prepare for fireworks if two Sims don't get along.
~currently modding & mod support is my main work; your support ensures that I can continue~Hello, I am Lumpinou! I make Sims 4 mods to enhance your experience. Recently acquired physical limitations have put a huge dent in my creative hopes and professional options. Modding for the Sims is my newfound way to still be creative. If you enjoy my mods – any support you can give would be more than appreciated.
Live your best Breaking Bad life in the Sims 4. The basemental download incorporates all the paraphernalia you can think of as well as new traits like addiction. The pack also comes with content for you to apply to your Sims such as dark circles and powdered noses. You can even grow your own weed supply. With Basemental Gangs, you can assign NPCs to belong to certain gangs and join one yourself. Mix this with the Extreme Violence mod for an even added extra fun.
The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience. Although the game is fun enough on its own (there's plenty of stuff you can do in The Sims 4 already), it gets even better when you're able to have more meaningful conversations, or fix the lag that's been bothering you. We selected some of the handiest, most entertaining, and most beautiful Sims 4 mods out there. Check the list to see which ones you like best, and you can install them right away!
