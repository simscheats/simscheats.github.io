Well, that’s not the case any longer! Introducing The Sims 4 Turbo Careers Mod Pack! For players who have both The Sims 4 and The Sims 4 Get to Work Expansion Pack, Turbo Careers turns all closed adult careers into open ones, as well as two of the teen careers (Fast Food and Barista).
An interesting mod for those who want more excitement in their careers instead of just getting into the “rabbit hole”. Turbo Careers is a mod that makes all careers for adults (and two for teenagers) work as the active careers in the Ao Trabalho expansion. You can download workplaces from the Gallery, including those with a combined function, or make your own - just make sure they have the right objects for Sims to do their job.
The career mega pack mod, created by Midnitetech (Patreon), allows your sims to have A TON of new career options in the game. These range from things like robbers, real estate agents, psychologists and so much more. You are able to add one of the careers to your game, or all if you choose, giving you total customization on which careers you may want.
Ever since the Get To Work expansion pack was launched, sims have been busy bees with their new playable careers. However, with only three trades to choose from, some players found this content lacking. One custom content creator felt the same way. Zerbu created Turbo Careers to allow simmers to follow their sims into 10 of the base game professions. Just like in Get To Work (which is required) players are prompted at the beginning of each work day to follow their sims. They will then perform tasks for jobs such as Criminal, Secret Agent, Entertainer, and even become an Astronaut.

The careers available in The Sims 4 base game are fine to begin with, but once you’ve been playing for a while, they are less than extensive. If you have been finding the career options a little boring, these mods are perfect for you! Here are my top 15 favorite career mods to add some variation into your game.
Also, it is worth remembering that some of these mods from The Sims 4 may ask for a specific DLC to work properly, such as The Sims 4 At Work. Remember that these personalized careers will not work with most other Sims 4 mods related to how careers work, such as Turbo Careers.
Updated on June 9, 2022, by Nahda Nabiilah:Thanks to the constant development of The Sims 4, a new Expansion Pack is released from time to time. Some packs add new CAS items, some add furniture, while others add new Careers. Careers are not a must in The Sims 4, as Sims can make money without getting a job. However, it does provide a real-life element and can sometimes make the gameplay more interesting. Therefore, if players wish to play comfortably, searching for the highest paying Career will surely make the experience a lot easier.
There are three types of Careers in The Sims 4. Some of these Careers affect players’ gameplay, like the Doctor Career, where players have to travel with their Sim to the job location. However, the others don’t take players to any locations, but the Sim either works from home or, like the Culinary Career, the Sim would disappear for a few hours.

## Turbo careers allows players to create custom career paths and navigate their way through the city regardless of their skill level.

Players are always adding new careers at ModTheSimsSo if you're tired of the game's standard careers and want to explore something new, take a look. The imagination behind each one is impressive, and most of them offer a fully interactive path to follow.
The Criminal Career was released with the Base Game. Upon reaching rank six, players will have to select one of the two Career branches: Boss and Oracle. The Sim ends up being a leader of a gang and the second one is more into internet crimes like cheating.
The Gardener Career is part of the Seasons Expansion Pack. Players can pick to go to work or work from home an hour before their shift starts. This Career branches out at level four into Botanist and Floral Designer. The first one relies on the Gardening skill, while the second relies on the Flower Arranging skill.
This fun career comes with 10 levels. Once you reach the top level, you’ll earn around §4000 simoleons a day! This career comes with 35 custom chance cards, 135 chance card outcomes and 135 buffs. Overall, this is a super fun career for the budding artist.
The Civil Designer Career is part of the Eco Lifestyle Expansion Pack. If players are into making plans to change their neighborhood to become more eco-friendly or love the idea of recycling and fabrication, this Career is for them. It has two branches: Civic Planner and Green Technician.
Both branches of the Style Influencer have a decent salary compared to the rest of the Careers: Trend Setter is one of them. Players will be able to choose one when they reach level five in the Style Influencer Career. This branch is perfect for Simmers who like inventing different clothing styles.
The creator, ItsKatato, has made a daycare venue so you can actively go to work! You can also change any existing lot to a daycare venue. There are 5 levels to progress through. You get paid §120 per day per child, plus a weekly stipend depending on your level. This mod requires a couple of other mods, as well as Get-To-Work and the Toddler Stuff pack.
If you want more culinary creativity, the Custom Food Interactions this is where you should start. It doesn't add ingredients or recipes to the game – it just adds new possible interactions to the kitchen equipment, with a structure that lets you create a fridge full of custom meals from other modders' kitchens.
