Titled ‘Sims 4 Mod Manager’, this tool is currently in the early stages of development. If one studies its mechanism, one feels that this is the kind of tool that can help one save up on a lot of time by simplifying the process of eliminating custom content that you don’t require anymore.
The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
The Sims 4 Mod/Custom Content Manager also makes the process of enabling and disabling Sims 4 mods and custom content from just one designated place, instead of transferring elements in and out of the Mods folder. The tool works most efficiently if you have a proper system in place. The tool is very new and yet to be properly tested by a large number of players. Therefore, the company is taking all the feedback it is getting about the tool very seriously and making changes to improve it constantly.
Anyone who uses Mods or Custom Content in The Sims 4, or even from any of previous The Sims games, will know that your Mods folder can sometimes feel a little overwhelming. However, GameTimeDev has created a program to help players keep their Mods folder organized.

The Mod & Custom Content Manager is described as a file explore with additional features which allows you to browse your files for The Sims 4 easily. You are able to delete and move files but also disable and enables files both on their own, in multiples or even whole folders. View files alongside thumbnails, which will help you distinguish content that is for Build Buy Mode or Create A Sim.
What are ModsMods are game modifications to the Sims 4, pure and simple. Practically any game that is moddable has mods. They may enhance a feature, or introduce entirely new features. Mod creators work hard to make sure their content is stable and adds the functionality that is described when they share it with the Sims community. Some mods greatly enhance gameplay, make minor adjustments to how things work (like how often objects break), or simply fix something that irritates a lot of players. Mod creators sometimes fix bugs before EA does, and may at times be more in tune with the community's desires for how something should work. For example, door locks were released in a patch, but first came in the form of a mod.
What this means is that, you can load and unload certain mods and CC whenever you like. If you deselect a bunch of various mods, then the next time you start The Sims 4 you won’t find those mods in there! To turn them back on, just exit the game and check them once again. This amazing tool allows for so much freedom when it comes to dictating your gameplay and we recommend using it!
What we mean to say is that, we think that every simmer, a newbie or a veteran, will find a lot of uses for the Mod Manager. Its main strengths are that it makes everything super simple, quick and easy to control. After a few minutes of using it, you will become a master and you will know where every mod file of yours is, whether it’s turned on or off, whether you need it or not…

## This sims 4 mod manager tutorial will show you how to use the mod manager to install and manage mods.

Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
And if you click on the furthermost tool in the same corner, the one labeled Open The Sims 4 “Mods” folder, you will be directed to the destination of your installed mod. Notice that if a mod isn’t checked/selected in the main list on the Mod Manger, then it won’t be shown in the folder either.
After you install the program, the main framework that you’ll be using in it is called Manage Mods. If you click on it, an empty page will open up. Since you have just now installed it for the first time, you will need to import all of your mods and CC. That’s easily done through the little plus “+” button at the bottom left corner. But be aware that sometimes the program links to your Sims 4 folder, and if you already have mods and CC loaded to the game, they might appear on the page.
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
To download the Sims 4 TOOL mod by TwistedMexi, you'll first need to find the mod page on her Patreon. Normally, you have to be a paying patron on Patreon to access creator posts, but TwistedMexi has listed this mod for public use, so you don't need to pay anything here. Follow these steps to download the mod:
About Mods and Custom ContentMods and Custom Content are wildly popular among Sims 4 players, but if you're new to the franchise you may be unaware what treasures await those who ravenously scour the web for the latest downloads. There is far more free content available to download than is included in the base game and all game/stuff packs combined. In this guide, I'll teach you how to install CC and mods, explain what they are and offer some direction on where to go from here by providing links to sites where you can binge-download CC for your game.
The Mods FolderNext, find or create the Mods folder. It should already be there, but if it's not you can right click in the white area within The Sims 4 folder and create a folder, being sure to name it Mods. The game automatically recognizes and attempts to utilize anything in this folder. So, once we download CC, we'll copy the files to that folder. Tip: You can have other folders inside the Mods folder, so if you'd like to separate out your CC and Mods in to separate folders, or even categorize them by object/clothing type, you can do so! Additionally, Forum member RandyH notes that it's possible to rename mods so long as you keep the .package at the end of the file name. This can make your organization even simpler, and possibly help you track things down easier. All of this is actually a good idea should you run into a mod or piece of CC that gives you trouble, so that it's easier to find and remove.
modthesims.info - Definitely my go-to, though I don't use CC heavily. Everything on MTS is totally free, and it's exceptionally well-organized. This makes for an easy browsing experience. They feature so much content that they are almost all you need in order to really beef up your game with CC. Of course, modthesims also has plenty of mods, and many of the best mod makers in The Sims community are members there.
