## Sims 4 fans can create their own mods, or modify existing ones, using the tools available in the game.

The list of possible Sims 4 mods is basically endless. You can spend hours and hours looking through various websites, trying to find out whether a given mod is useful or just a waste of time. Over dozens of hours, we’ve tested a plethora of mods and hand-picked the ones most worthy of your attention. Through some trial and error, we’ve also listed which mods contradict each other and won’t function if both are installed at the same time.

To help you navigate what's on offer, here’s a lineup of the best Sims 4 mods, from the little tweaks, to the digital life-changers. Make sure to read the installation section, and double check for any conflicts to make sure you’re not running two that will butt heads.
Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
Like many PC games, the Sims 4 has a large modding community. While some mods offer primarily cosmetic changes to the game in the form of furniture or character customizations, other Sims 4 mods add new places to explore or new ways to interact with other sims. The best part is that mods like the Extreme Violence Mod are available for free.
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!

This handy mod by Weerbesu makes using Sims 4 cheats a breeze if you don't know the lot by heart. Right-clicking various parts of the normal Sims 4 interface will give you extra options for things like giving a household more money, promoting Sims in their careers, or changing the in-game time. You can find the full list of features by scrolling down a bit on the download page.
Many of the best Sims 4 mods affect the ways Sims interact with each other. The Sims 4 has a long list of traits that change the way a Sim behaves, and because they’re relatively easy for modders to create you can quickly expand that list through custom content.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
@Sophiexxxxxxxx, a little bit of clarification. If you just want hairstyles, clothing, furniture, eye colors, etc. then what you want is called Cutsom Content (CC). But if what you want changes the actual gameplay than that is a Mod.But, if you get Mods or CC you will need to maintain them. That requires a bit of work on your part. Every time the game is updated by EA, like right before a pack is to be released, there is a chance that some Mods/CC can become outdated. When Mods/CC become outdated, you need to replace them with updated ones, if the maker has updated that item. If you don't replace or get rid of outdated CC/Mods, then your game will have problems. You can always check for Mod/CC conflicts and clean up any corrupted data from them by doing the following:1) Move the Mods Folder to your desktop2) Delete localthumbcache.package file in the game folder.3) Fix you game in Origin by logging in and go to Library, then right-click on The Sims 4 and choose the "Repair Game" option from the list. Wait until Origin finishes repairing all your packs and not just the base game.4) Now, when you turn on your game again, it will create a new mods folder that will be empty. Check to see if your game is now working without mods/CC.5) Now you can try adding back items from your Mods folder one at a time checking your game each time to see which item is causing your game to not work properly. If you have a lot of items, you can try the 50/50 Method. Then you can go back to the CC/Mod creators and get the updated versions when they are available. If you still want to use Mods/CC, then the sites that @Psychotps gave you are good ones as they have been around since at least The Sims 2! (I used to use Mods and CC in TS2 and TS3, but no longer do so because I don't want to have to keep up with maintaining them.) But please keep in mind everything that @Psychotps and @RandomBuzziness suggested about downloading.Happy Simming!

## Modding gives fans a way to create content that can be shared with other players, and makes the game more enjoyable for everyone.

Mods: Game modifications made by fans of the game. These modifications change the way your game behaves. There are small mods that make minor changes to the game, but there are also very large mods that completely overhaul existing features in the game or add brand new features to the game. Mods need to be updated frequently to keep your game running well.
Mods are much more than mere visual enhancers as they can fundamentally change the way the game operates. These mods change the way you play Skyrim, from adding new methods of attacking, through different ways to traverse the world, and altering the way the user interface works.
Naturally, some fans are pretty upset about this update. There are plenty of hard-working individuals who put a lot of effort into creating mods for the game. For some of them, their knowledge of programming has allowed them to earn a little extra income as they mod the game. However, EA has stated that “mods cannot be sold, licensed, or rented for a fee, nor can mods contain features that would support monetary transactions of any type.”
The mod provides you with a huge amount of new interactions. You can develop your own Romance Skill and a Cheat Skill, your Sims can feel “Affectionate,” they can now go to counseling (couples or singles), and go on Rabbit Hole Dates with their partners. You also have the option of going on Online Dates, which pairs nicely with the Sim DaDating App mod that you can download separately. What really took me by surprise was how intricate the leveling up of the romance skill was. Each level unlocks new interactions and makes everyday gameplay even more fun.
The number one thing you need to know about mods is that they break. They break a LOT. After almost every single game update, in fact. This means that you’ll be redownloading your mods constantly. If this sounds like too much hassle for you, then mods are probably not for you. If you are willing to keep your Mods folder maintained on a regular basis, then continue reading!
The Extreme Violence mod also adds other new mechanics that makes the game more interesting to play. For example, players can murder as many Sims as they want until the grim reaper beats the player up. Players can also clean up evidence after committing a murder, such as washing blood off or hiding bruises.
We’ve put together a comprehensive list of the best Skyrim mods we think are essential to improving Skyrim above and beyond the out-the-box experience. They’ll make the vanilla 2011-released game look better than even the 2016 Special Edition version. And, best of all, every one of these Skyrim mods is free! No wonder there’s been over one billion mod downloads between Skyrim and Fallout.
LMS is an awesome modder and has a huge selection of 100+ mods for you to choose from, and many of them work together. I had over 50 mods installed at one time, because of the Small Mods Package she provides. This gives you tons of little mods all in one zip, that fix little issues or improve gameplay in some way. These are all named appropriately so you’ll know exactly what they do. Even if you weren’t interested the mods I listed above, there may be some that interest you in this package. Just be sure to look through them and only put the ones you really want in your mods folder.
