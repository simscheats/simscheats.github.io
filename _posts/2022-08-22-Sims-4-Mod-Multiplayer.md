## Create and manage a sims 4 multiplayer community.

Always one step ahead, the Sims community has already created a serious mod to bring multiplayer to The Sims 4. The Sims 4 Multiplayer mod is designed to let you play with other people in real-time on a local network. The mod basically uses one PC as a server, which allows two players to join the same game. It's still in closed beta, but the developer has a Patreon (opens in new tab) to support the project and hopes to expand the mod to allow more than two players in the future.

As ever, there are dozens of ways to play this game, whether you’re a weirdo like me who finds inner peace looking at furniture options, or someone who wants to find creative ways to murder characters. Shoving a lot of sims into one house makes co-op even easier. While your sim is showering or heading off to work, hand the controller to a friend and let them instruct their sim to write a novel or flirt with their neighbor.
If you’ve been waiting for a multiplayer experience for The Sims 4, you can now download the Muliplayer Mod by thepancake1 to play the game with a friend! The Multiplayer Mod allows you to connect to a server with someone else so you can play together in the same save file at the same time! Here’s a recent video from onlyabidoang.
After setting up a host computer, players can join a world and start building homes and families together. S4MP also has support for other popular interaction mods like Wonderful and Wicked Whims. There are even dedicated servers for supporters who donate to the creator.

The Sims 4 multiplayer could be the most requested feature that players have asked for over the years, and it's a topic of discussion that regularly comes up around the game. Naturally it would be an improvement if your digital neighbors were actual real people that you could have meaningful collaborations with, and although EA always shows a lot of support to the Sims communities that form around each release in the series they've never really achieved this goal. Attempts have been made to incorporate online elements in previous releases with varying levels of success, but – officially at least – there's still no way for regions in The Sims 4 to connect up. However, that doesn't mean it will never happen, so here's everything we know about EA's plans for Sims 4 multiplayer, along with some predictions about what we might see in the future.
One of the PCs will act as a server and should do the following additional steps:1. Start the launcher2. Host a game by selecting an already created save file3. Start The Sims 4, load the save file, and enter your household4. You should see a notification verifying your game has successfully connected to the server.
If you’re open to handling content on your own and enjoy trying out new things, the best Sims 4 mods offer a variety of options for breathing new life into your ho-hum Sim lifestyle. Choose one, or all, and see what new opportunities you can find in the game. But if you’re looking for a few to get you started, try the Sorcerer, Get a Job, and/or MC Command Center mods.
I remember downloading a free trial of Sims 4 and being really disappointed with it. Some of the mods sound like they should be included in the game already, such as the MC Command Center. However, reading this has gotten me all nostalgic for the older games, so I might give Sims 4 a try and keep these mods bookmarked to add after playing the original version for a bit. Thanks for the information.

## Use community resources to build and share mods.

Single mods aren’t quite the same as packages. Packages are larger groups of mods or features that may need to be downloaded, extracted, and installed one by one, depending on how they were created. Follow the documentation to see what you’ll need to do to maximize any project
Download the Go to School mod here and make sure you follow ALL the directions on Zerbu's page to get it to work correctly, and don't forget to download an elementary and high school for your town. You can also find my CC-free school creations under the gallery by searching "brittpinkie" as well. This link will bring you to the newest version, V4, which includes new interactions, NPCs, a teaching career and a lot more.
Modders and CC creators have increasingly begun to upload their content onto their own sites instead of ModTheSims (for many reasons, but that's another article). There's nothing wrong with that, but you need to be careful, as some creators hide their download links behind a thing called AdFly, or host their downloads on really spammy sites. The best thing is to use AdBlocker when downloading; it'll keep you safe from viruses or overly spammy AdFly pages!
Though all of these mods have been tested and should work functionally with your game, be aware that 3rd party content could potentially cause damage. Always download from trusted sites/users who have tested their content before sharing, and always be sure to backup your game files BEFORE installing mods and other CC. If you do run into any issues after installation, remove the mod from your game and consider informing its creator about the issue.
As I update this page, I'll be "retiring mods" from the list. That doesn't mean that they're not still worth downloading or that they're broken; it simply means that there are newer, cooler mods to download at the moment. Here's some of the mods that I once featured here, which are still worth adding to your game:
EA decreed that all mods “must be non-commercial and distributed free-of-charge. Mods cannot be sold, licensed, or rented for a fee, nor can mods contain features that would support monetary transactions of any type.” They went on to add, “Maxis recognises that creating mods takes time and resources. Accordingly, mod developers may recoup their development costs via passive advertisements and donations.”
More new careers are coming out each day! Check out ModTheSims for custom careers like Game Developer, Adventurer, Real Estate, Cheater, Nursing, Florist, and Tarot Card Reader! Meanwhile, don't forget to check out SSSVitlans' career tag on Tumblr; there are tons of cool careers there too from different modders, including Talk Show Host, Mortician, Dog Walker and Photographer!
I love the work from home mods by NoelleBelleFleur! She's taken the work at home mechanism which comes with the "City Living" expansion pack and applied it to several base-game careers, including Astronaut, Tech Guru, Painter, Culinary, Entertainer, Business, Athlete and Writer, so that your Sims can choose whether to go to work each day or stay home and complete tasks. Of course, "City Living" is required, but these are great additions to the game, especially for Sims who have children at home or other hobbies where they may need to have a more flexible home/work life.
