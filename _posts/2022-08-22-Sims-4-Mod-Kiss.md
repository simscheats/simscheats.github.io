## Create a sims 4 mod that allows players to kiss each other.

Wow! Some of those cheats are super long and quite complex. That’s why I just use mods to quickly and easily cheat my sims relationships. No more having to write out long cheat codes. With the click of a few buttons, I can alter my sim’s relationships. The mods I’m going to share with you are also listed in my must-have mods for sims 4 post because they are essential for playing the sims 4.

This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
With this mod by Sacrificial, which can be downloaded here, your Sims can enjoy a slow romantic dance together. Unlike in the regular game, Sims will put their arms around each other and gaze at each other, looking totally smitten. They can also be prompted to hug or have a little make-out session while dancing. While this is going on, they will get flirty moodlets, and their romance bar for the couple will increase.
You can also use cheats codes to make your sims quickly fall in love. To do this, use the cheat code modifyrelationship {PlayedSimFirstName} {PlayedSimLastName} {TargetSimFirstName} {TargetSimLastName} 100 LTR_Romance_Main. Add in your sim’s name, in the first part, and the sim you want them to fall in love with, in the second part.
You can either add specific skills, traits and appearance traits or simply randomize preferences. Sims will have an easier time building relationships with other Sims that possess the respective traits. They’ll quickly become friends or lovers, enjoying friendly interactions.

I've found that the best way to make poly sims is to use the player trait but also, in the case of marriage with poly sims, you can use the cheat relationship.add_bit family_husband_wife on all of the people within the relationship so it registers them as married
This mod is simple, but there’s no denying that a little goes a long way. Downloading this will allow your sims to experience a beautiful moment with their significant other--skygazing. Oh, can you believe that? It can’t get any better than that! What’s a more romantic way to enjoy each other’s company other than lying on the flat ground and studying the stars? Or perhaps clouds. Whichever one you prefer.
If you want to play a real player in The Sims 4, consider downloading this custom trait by modder Sims_Lover. You can give your Sim the "Woohoo Lover" trait to turn him into a serious playboy (or to turn her into a serious playgirl). Your Sims with this trait will get the urge to woohoo a lot, and get more romantic buffs for woohoo-ing.
That’s it! It’s seriously so easy. Obviously, this mod is SUPER helpful! With this mod, I almost never have to type cheat codes in. So if you’re looking for a way to cheat your sim’s relationships really fast without much work, this is the mod that you need.

## Create a sims 4 mod that allows players to kiss in various ways.

Some Sims start earlier than others, and there are times when young adults and teens might find themselves to be more than friends. This mod by Polarbearsims allows for kisses and romance between different age categories from teen and up, and can be downloaded here.
Ever wish your sims could expand their dating pool a little? See who else is out there besides the few sims that show up at the bar every night, or that one sim that seems to work at every food stall in every world every single day? Well, this mod’s got you covered. From blind dates to one-night-stands, your sim will have more options than they know what to do with. There’s even an add-on for Wicked Whims for those of you who want some really … really fun hook ups.
This simple mod takes care of a minor annoyance found in The Sims: without using mods, neck kissing is only available for teens. Community content creator Shimrod101 made a small mod that opens up this option for young adults, adults and elders, as well as removing Lockout Time and Cooldown limits so couples can enjoy themselves without them. This mod can be downloaded here.
The Gender Preference mod lets you change the preferences Sims have for romantic partners of particular genders (in The Sims 4 currently that’s just two, female and male). You can adjust the numbers to set your Sims to prefer one gender to the exclusion of the other, to prefer one but also like the other, or to like both equally. Romance away.
Sims 4 romance mods are great for refurbishing the monotonous and un-detailed version of romantic interactions in the base game. Moreover, these are some of the best ones that hold the capacity to add more excitement to your gaming experience. So, get them now and have fun playing!
If you’re looking to change the game even more, have a proper dig into the Create a Sim ‘custom gender settings’ in the base game. They were updated a while back and now provide you with more options, such as the ability to allow same-sex couples to fall pregnant.
For the hopeless romantics out there, few things pull on the heartstrings as much as a smooth dip kiss. This simple yet gorgeous animation by Mia has one of the Sims approach the other, initiate a kiss then dip before standing up and wrapping up with a kiss on the nose. Hearts will melt, so get ready when you download it.
"Kiss a Sim" appears as a Daily Wish sometimes. If you have your Lover, you can simply visit him/her to perfrom the action. Unless you need to get a romantic interest and get the relationship level up to 3 to unlock the relationship event to change the status into Lover.
