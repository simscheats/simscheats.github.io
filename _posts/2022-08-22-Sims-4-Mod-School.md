But before that, here are the best Sims 4 school mods that you can use. Enjoy!
And now we have something a little bit different. This mod is a real quality of life change for every Sims 4 player. Why is it genius? Because it removes the need for your Sim to complete their goals in order to advance their grades in school. You won’t even see those goals anymore and instead your Sim’s grades will only be influenced by their work performance. You can find this most useful change on modthesims.info or you can download it directly from here. The creator is Reubenhood.
There are more awesome features in this mod, but I’d like you to explore them for yourself. In a nutshell, the Go to School mod is the complete school experience for Sims 4. It introduces everything you’d ever need in a school mod, so I recommend you try it.
Doesn’t it feel annoying sending your Sims to school and not really seeing anything of their education? Right, it sucks. Luckily, we’ve got another awesome pack for you. This one makes school actually fun by allowing you to follow your Sims in school. Classrooms, gyms, halls and locker room talks – everything is included! Now your Sim can make friends, pick subjects and enjoy school. Created by Zerbu in 2015, this mod is improved and built on many times. It is also tremendously popular and loved by many Sims 4 players. This extension mod can be downloaded from the Tumblr account: zerbu.tumblr.com or by following the direct link here.

The official name of the Go to School mod is The Sims 4 Go to School Mod Pack V4. It’s created by Zerbu, a mod creator that we often feature here on SnootySims. The Go to Shool mod dates back from 2017, and it’s one of the most popular mods for the game even today. I remember that everybody loved it when it first came out, and worth trying it out!
And for the youngest we have brought you this amazing Preschool Mod. Now your toddlers can attend school, learn new things and build skills, which will be a relief for your adult Sims because they won’t have to teach each toddler everything. This extension mod comes with many interactions and fun stuff that your toddlers can do. To download this fantastic addition click here and if you want to find more of the amazing creator (which you should) visit his page: kawaiistaciemods.com. Have a blast!
Have you ever dreamed of life without school? No early wake ups, no getting ready in a hurry, no attending boring classes? Just… living? If yes, then we’ve got the perfect extension mod for you which prevents your Sims from being enrolled in school. Now they can enjoy the world and pursue their goals with freedom! This mod is created by Azoresman and you also find it on modthesims.info or download it directly from our link here. Don’t miss out on this one!
The first day of classes is right around the corner; in the meantime remember to connect with future classmates on The Sims 4 Forums, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, like us on Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel. You can also sign up for The Sims 4 newsletter.

## You can find the mod school in your game's expansion pack, the sims 4 get to work.

You should use the Sims 4 Go to School mod as the best school tool for the game. The first thing you need to do is to download and install the actual mod. Second, you’ll need to place one of the two new avenues on a lot. And third, you’ll need to send your Sims to attend school!
And for the end we have this amazing and helpful mod by Diffevair. End the school time earlier for your Sims and set them free to conquer the world! Make the boredom end and let the adventures begin! You can download this mod from modthesims.info or by following our direct link here. Don’t wait too long for this one!
We wouldn’t be we if we didn’t find something for the Kids Sims too! Here is a wonderful Elementary School you can send them to and follow their school days closely. It has amazing classrooms, cozy ambience and beautiful design – everything your Sims need to feel inspired and ready to achieve their goals. This works as an addition to the previous Go To School Mod Pack and makes it more complete. It is created by Sim4fun and you can download it from modthesims.info or by clicking on the direct link here. Go try it!
Follow your Sims to school and help them achieve their education. Attend a different subject every day with the teacher NPC, and demonstrate your knowledge through activity goals. Bored? See the Counsellor for a boost of spirit. Want more to do? Elementary students can apply for special opportunities (unlockable aspirations) from the Principal for a chance to earn Emblems and redeem them for reward traits that will help them later in life.
Go to School adds two new venue types: Elementary School and High School. In order for the mod to work, you’ll need to place these lots somewhere in your game, otherwise you won’t receive the option to follow your Sim to school. You can find these venues on the gallery, or you can build your own.
This is the first time that a high school in the franchise hasn't been a rabbit hole or an off-screen occurrence. As with other lots in the Sims 4, they can be edited; even the lots used in active careers with the free build cheat "bb. enablefreebuild". It is assumed that the free build cheat will also work with Copperdale High, allowing players to make changes or even completely customize the high school.
Sims can also be enrolled in private school by inviting the headmaster and suitably impressing him with good food, a guided tour and the right social interactions. The hours are the same, but needs are put under less strain and all students change into a default school uniform before leaving for school. Public school and private school share the same school bus.
High School Years introduces Social Bunny, essentially a Sims Twitter you can access by clicking the phone icon in the bottom left of your screen. Different events, like eating cafeteria food or reminiscing about a party, will prompt you to create different pre-written status updates that you can customise by setting a tone, like embarrassed or happy. You can also accept and send friend requests to Sims you meet and DM them friendly, flirty, or mean messages or tag them in posts. But think before you type — targeted messages can affect your relationship with Sims for better or worse.
