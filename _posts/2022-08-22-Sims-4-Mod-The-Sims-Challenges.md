## Create and share sims 4 challenges with other players.

Some may seem simple but others might require some extra work on your part – don’t be scared if this means going off the beaten path because these Sims4 Challenges offer something different than anything else out there today and no two players have had quite the same experience yet.

This is another HUGELY popular The Sims 4 Challenge- probably in part because everyone loves Disney-related things, and also due to the fun and creativity of the challenge. The challenge was created by Playingwithmah over on the Sims forums, and is available for both The Sims 3 and The Sims 4. In The Sims 4, you must:
We’ve all been there, we start binge playing The Sims 4 and after a few days we run out of ideas for our boring regular families and need something more interesting to do. We could try a custom scenario to add new gameplay but we’ve tried them all, we could add an interesting new mod to try out a new type of gameplay or you could go ahead and try out a number of sims 4 challenges!
These challenges are amazing because they range from every single type of gameplay you could possibly experience for the game and there is something out there for every type of player. Want to play with kids? 100 Baby Challenge! Want to play with aliens? Alien Widow Challenge! There really is something on this list of sims 4 challenges for everyone.
Even with all of these options to let your creativity run wild in The Sims, sometimes gameplay can work itself into a boring rut. That's where challenges come in. Challenges are usually created by players and shared online to make gameplay more fun or difficult. There are rules to each challenge and some can be pretty strict, but don't forget that the point is to have fun and make the challenge your own.

My idea: World War3. Move your sims into an underground (cellar) plot and lock the door. This is your bunker you cannot leave. Not even to go to your mailbox. No jobs or school. I created a group of stereotypical characters. Evil lecherous man with hidden agenda, medical doctor with chip on his shoulder, brooding soldier, sexy teen girl and solo surviving mom. Have them survive and even repopulate the world. Works awesome with "off-the-grid".
Updated February 24th, 2020: Playing through different challenges in The Sims 4 is a really fun way to add some excitement to the game. Although a lot of the appeal in this game is being able to do whatever we want without rules, having some fun restrictions added into the game can make things a lot more interesting. There are so many around the Internet to choose from and try out on your Sim families. Because talented Sims fans are constantly coming up with new challenges, we've come back and added five more unique gameplay challenges.
The game isn’t perfect, so we often need to find these challenges so you can have a guide to follow to make your gameplay more fresh and unique. Sims 4 Legacy challenges are one of the best ways to mix it up because these challenges require you to play for many generations of a single family allowing you to get really attached and just have a great time!
To set this option on our list of sims 4 challenges up you have a single sim that you get to control and the other 7 are going to be allowed to do whatever they want whenever they want. All 8 sims have to have the erratic trait (formerly insane) and will have their other traits and aspiration randomized.

## Set up and administer sims 4 challenges.

Once you have the 3 set up you are going to play each of them for a day rotating each day to a new sim and only controlling them on a single day and letting them do whatever they want on the days you aren’t controlling them. The point of this challenge is to see what happens when the sims aren’t being controlled and if they are successful on their days off!
Now, this kind of seems a bit like Sims 4 itself. A fake world, orchestrated by an all-powerful idol (you!), be it the player or a reality TV show director. However, the catch here is that you cannot control the Sim being subjected to the challenge. Instead, you influence this Sim through other Sims and try to make them lead an entirely normal life. A very interesting challenge inspired by a classic. Read the rules and specifics in the challenge thread here.
The challenges in The Sims 4 are ways of playing the game differently. Sometimes, even the most casual players get bored by the game, so we offer challenges to patch things up. These challenges are series of tasks that the simmer must complete while following certain rules.
The Sims 4 Generation Challenge is a set of challenges that can be completed in order to earn rewards. The first challenge, The Young Adult Challenge, is available from the start of the game and requires players to complete tasks such as living on their own for a period of time, having a high score in various activities, and making friends. Completing all six challenges rewards players with the ability to create a Sim who is aged 25 or younger.
When you’re setting up this choice for sims 4 challenges you’re going to make your sim the owner of a hotel and you can have one other sim in your household to help as a cleaner or chef for the hotel but they must be the opposite gender. You’ll get to make as big of a hotel as you want and decorate however you want as long as the rooms have a bathroom, a double bed and a TV.
To set this up you’ll have 8 sims in the household with various ages (from young adult to elder) and a nice mix of traits to keep it interesting. Make sure to involve some negative traits like slob or erratic to keep it way more interesting. You can make them look however you’d like!
Have you ever thought of running a hotel in Sims 4? This challenge is something like that but with a psycho twist. You can say that it’s disturbing, but hey, there are a lot of weird things you can do in this game. It’s basically a twist on the Kidnap Challenge.
Like these challenges you make a staring sim based on the color "red" when they have a child there childs color would be "orange" and so on so forth. i need help figuring out the stages of what you need to complete. ANY SIMS 4 GAMEPLAYER OR ANYTHING CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS CHALLENGE!
