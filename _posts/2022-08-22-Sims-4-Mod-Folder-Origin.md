## Sims 4 mod folders can be created in a few different ways.

Step 1 - create the new location: copy your Mods directory (or whichever directory you wish) to your desired location. Just remember the file path to your new Mods location. When I was done copying, I had the following file path structure: "E:\Sims 4 Mods\Mods"

Custom content and general mods: These files end in .package. Open the Mod folder the game has created (Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods) and copy all the mod files into the folder. You can create additional subfolders to organize your growing mod collection better.
The Mods FolderNext, find or create the Mods folder. It should already be there, but if it's not you can right click in the white area within The Sims 4 folder and create a folder, being sure to name it Mods. The game automatically recognizes and attempts to utilize anything in this folder. So, once we download CC, we'll copy the files to that folder. Tip: You can have other folders inside the Mods folder, so if you'd like to separate out your CC and Mods in to separate folders, or even categorize them by object/clothing type, you can do so! Additionally, Forum member RandyH notes that it's possible to rename mods so long as you keep the .package at the end of the file name. This can make your organization even simpler, and possibly help you track things down easier. All of this is actually a good idea should you run into a mod or piece of CC that gives you trouble, so that it's easier to find and remove.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.

After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
@dunstz Here is another great article about organizing and maintaining mods and CC:https://simscommunity.info/2018/08/08/the-sims-4-how-to-ensure-a-healthy-game/2/@Psychotps I think the default number of sub-folders for .package files is 5 levels deep unless you edit your Resource.cfg file.EDIT: @Psychotps I meant to add awesome post on Mods folder organization and maintenance!
Hi;Usually it's recommended to run a Repair on the game after an issue with the Mod folder starts giving issues, so that the game will recreate it. That said, usually the game will read the Mods folder if you create a new one.If you are having issues with Mods, make sure you also remove the Localthumbcache.package file in the Sims 4 folder before you move your CC back into the new Mods folder; this should force the game to have to re-identify the CC you have in it.Make sure in-game as well that your Custom Content Mods and Script Mods are enabled.- B

## Sims 4 mod folders can be created on a pc.

or instead you can copy your mods folder to your desk top to make a copy and then delete the mods folder that is in your Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4. Do not delete the copy you put on your desktop or you will lose all of your mods and custom content.
Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
I recently got a new laptop and downloaded Windows 10 on it. I downloaded Sims 4, (I had played it before on other laptops) and I wanted to put custom content in my game, like always. But I searched and I couldn't find the mods folder anywhere in the Electronic Arts/The Sims 4. I also couldn't find the saves folder either. Does anybody else have this problem, know anything about it, know how to help??
Unfortunately, Sims 4 doesn’t have mod support for the PS4. Games generally have minimal modding options on consoles, and games that allow you to change the gameplay are a minority. The developer has no current plans to enable custom content on the PS4, so don’t get your hopes up.
Go to your Mods folder and right-click it. Again, copy it to your Desktop. Once you're sure you have a copy of your Mods folder on your Desktop, go ahead and delete the copy in your Sims 4 folder. Restart your game and play it for a few minutes. If your game runs without crashing or having errors, you know the issue is with one of your Mods. If it doesn't, you'll need to go out and repair your game (and the issue is something within your Sims 4 game itself).
Go to your Sims 4 folder, right-click on the folder titled "Saves" and then copy it. Paste your Saves folder somewhere else on your computer, like your desktop. That way you'll have a "safe" version of your saved game in case anything goes wrong while testing.
I'm not sure whether you're still having the problem but I not long ago had the problem too, I do everything that everyone stated above but nothing even played for 5 minutes (probably longer) but I think I might of found a way you can find it, Not sure whether it'll work but... Click on This PC, then Click on your C Drive, which'll look like this -- Acer ( C : ) (Without spaces) -- If you've clicked on it, then you'll see a bunch of folders, Some with program files, etc.. Click on the folder that says 'Users' then once you've done that, Click on the one folder that has your PC's name on it, Like what you've named your PC, For example mine's -- Shyanne -- As that's my name, I know original, but once you've done that then you'll see all the same folders you have at the side but for some strange reason are completely different, click on documents after the PC's named folder, once you've also done that you'll be directed to some more folders, Click on Electronic Arts then Sims 4 then Mods. Hopefully this helped I do really suck at explaining stuff, I also tend to babble, If you understand anything from above then awesome.If there's nothing there still then I have no absolute clue, I do hope you get it solved quick though as I know it's horrible specially when you'd like to play the game. - Shy. xoxo.
The good news is modding your game isn’t as hard as you think. Sims Community is here to help. We’ll be clarifying any technical terms you might come across while looking for mods and CC, dispelling common myths about mods and CC, and walking you through the process of installing and maintaining your mods and CC step-by-step.

## Sims 4 mod folders can be created on a mac.

Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)
i just bought a new mac, the latest version. I had all my saves and mods from over 1 year of playing so i would like to put it in my new mac, i already installed the sims 4 from origin but i cannot find the electronic arts or sims 4 folder… the game works; but there are no folders on the mac so i dont know how to put my saved games and mods!!!! Thanks
So I’ve had a few requests here and there regarding mods and custom content for The Sims 4 on Mac, now that it has finally been released. If you know about my mods guide for The Sims 3, you would know that it was written for the sole purpose of making it easier to understand for those who aren’t familiar with using mods or custom content (CC) in their games. Hopefully, this one will do the exact same thing for you all.
@sofiafg10The game creates the Sims 4 folder in the Electronic Arts folder when you first launch it so if you have just installed the game it won't yet have been created. Also, do you have iCloud Drive enabled? If so then your Documents folder may be moved to the the cloud. Please see here for more info - http://answers.ea.com/t5/The-Sims-Mac/READ-FIRST-Sims-4-Mac-Help-Guides-and-Troubleshooting/m-p/5866...
I don't have a Sims 4 Electronic Arts folder. I have a Mac and the only things that come up when I search for it in Finder are the Sims 4 and Origin, which take me to the game. I want to download custom content, but I can't without a Mods or Electronic Arts folder. If you know any other way to get CC or how to help, that would be great. Thank you!
btw, do you know of any mods tracker for ts4 mac? if not, do you have any advices or useful tips? i installed a whole bunch of mods at once and my game keeps crashing now x/ when i manage to get it loading my sims does not interact with each other when i click for them to interact like ask about day or share interest.
The Sims 4 has many unofficial mods and Custom Content that you can install to expand upon or improve gameplay, such as texture mods, new hairstyles and eye colors, custom houses, and more. This page teaches you everything you need to know about How to Install Mods in TS4 and where to find CC on PC and Mac.
