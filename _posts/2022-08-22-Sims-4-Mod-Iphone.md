Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.

Once you start downloading mods, you may not want to stop. However, you should note that some mods don’t play well with other ones. In severe cases, the game won’t run properly, or at all. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of mods while preventing mishaps:
In the Mods folder, create a Mods Tutorial (any name will suffice) subfolder and move all of the “.package” files from the downloads folder into the Mods Tutorial folder. CC that appears in the “Create a Household” screen (clothes, hair, accessories, etc.) will be stored in the “CAS” folder, Build/Buy CC should go in the “Build Buy Mods” folder, and so on.
Installing the mods is somewhat of a misnomer, as you don’t need to follow an installation process. Once you have downloaded the mod files and opened them with an unzipping program, the steps will differ based on the types of mod you’re downloading. There are four main categories:
Whether you’re using Steam or Origin to play the game, the process for downloading the mods doesn’t change. Since Steam hasn’t enabled the Workshop for Origin games, you can’t keep a list of mods directly on the platform and have to download each mod manually.
