## How to get pregnant in the sims 4.

In The Sims 4, there are (currently) only 2 ways for a Sim to get pregnant. One is during alien abductions, and another is through a special Woohoo option that shows up when your Sim has a high enough relationship with their partner. In the real world the status of a relationship doesn't necessarily have anything to do with having a baby, and the Risky Woohoo mod, by PolarBearSims, adds a bit more realism (and surprise) to pregnancy.

That is until this Sims 4 pregnancy mod by Tanja1986 was released. Through the power of science, anyone can now become pregnant if they so wish, which just takes away a ton of hassle from the game and makes romance gameplay so much more interesting and diverse for Simmers.
There are a lot of players of The Sims 4 that want to be able to get teens pregnant and experience teen pregnancy in their game, but since The Sims is a family friendly game they can’t add it to the vanilla game as many parents of players would think its inappropriate. However, you can add teen pregnancy with mods!
An interesting point about pregnancy in The Sims 4 is that your sims become super-human. Pregnant sims can’t die in the game and also completely stop aging while pregnant which is a weird concept. If your sim has enough babies they can actually outlive many of their children who don’t decide to spend most of their lives pregnant.
When playing The Sims 4 you can often be really bored with how pregnancy works, your sims don’t suffer enough, they aren’t living it super realistically and it’s just annoying. Downloading even just one of these sims 4 pregnancy mods you can completely change how you see pregnancy and enjoy the game. Happy playing!

Say you want your Sim to have a baby that's their biological offspring, but don't want to wait three or four in-game days and deal with the hassle of pregnancy. The following cheat allows you to skip straight to labour once your Sim is confirmed pregnant (i.e. has the 'Eating for Two' moodlet).
Once you get to this point, go and try for a baby! As always, the pregnancy odds in The Sims 4 are pretty high, but that still doesn’t mean that it will happen on the first try. You might have to go for a couple of times before your teen girl will be eating for two.
Sometimes when playing The Sims we may have a sim get pregnant and we didn’t actually mean for that to happen or our storylines have changes since we tried for baby. Having something like the pregnancy terminator installed in your game will help this.
With the vanilla game you can only get pregnant with a male sim and a female sim unless you use the gender options in create-a-sim. You can make it so any sims are able to get each other pregnant without these different gender options by using the babies for everyone mod.

## How to create a child in the sims 4.

Adopting a Baby, Toddler, or ChildIn The Sims 4, babies can be produced using Try For Baby or using the computer to adopt. (Choose Household, then Adopt). Adoption costs $1,000 and the player gets to choose between a baby, toddler, and a child. You also get to pick the one you wish to adopt. The computer will show pictures and names of the available babies, toddlers, and children. Click on the one you want. My Sim chose a baby named Savannah. She immediately walked out of the house and disappeared at the street. About an hour later, you'll get a notice that your Sim is bringing home a new family member. You'll also be given the option to change the name of the baby you pick. Your Sim returns with some confetti and the baby is magically in the bassinet. Adopting a toddler or child works the same way.
There are many ways to play the game and you don't need to have Sim babies if you don't want to; however, if you plan on playing a legacy game in The Sims 4 with multiple generations of the same Sim family, you'll probably want to have your Sims trying for babies pretty regularly.
If you’re wanting to choose how many babies you want your sims to have you may want to download the choose number of babies mod for the game. You can choose a file to download from 1 to 3 babies so the default will change and you can choose how large you want your sim’s family to be.
Not every Sim in The Sims 4 is strictly human. To date, the occult creature type line-up includes ghosts, aliens, vampires, mermaids, spellcasters, and Servos. Ghosts and Servos can't 'Try for Baby' to have biological children (though they can still adopt), but the rest can get pregnant and have babies just like an ordinary Sim.
CAS Options - Make Sim TransgenderDuring Create-a-Sim, you can select '...' beneath the gender settings to make your Sim however you desire. Sims can have masculine voice and feminine appearance, and you may also select whether that Sim is capable of becoming pregnant regardless of gender. You must pick one or the other - Sims who can become pregnant can't get others pregnant. You may also choose neither, indicating that Sim can woohoo without any baby being born.
If your prospective parents live apart, only the Sim who can 'Become Pregnant' needs to worry about their existing household size, since babies are added to the birth parent's household once they're born (even if you're playing with the non-birth parent as your active Sim).
Now you can influence how many births they have at once. It may work up to 7, but keep in mind that the maximum household size is 8. So do a little addition, and save your game first. It may hang quite a bit generating all these babies. Use the Sim's ID you got from the first cheat, for example 1341302010235.
Preparing the NurseryIn Sims 4, the only baby item is the bassinet. You may purchase one prior to the birth, or one will be provided by Social Services when the baby is born if you don't own one. The bassinet doesn't take up much space and can easily be kept in the mother's bedroom if you don't want to bother with making a separate nursery. Consider building up a bedroom for your baby before it ages up to Toddler. You'll need a high chair, toddler bed, and potty chair.
