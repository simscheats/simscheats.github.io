## Add new activities to the sims 4 after school time.

The Sims 4 after school activities mod by kawaiistaciefeatures 36 programs for kid and teen Sims. All of them are connected and require a unique skill. But they present another way of leveling up that skill too. For example, the Athletics after school activity is meant for Sims with the Athletics skill.

Now that The Sims 4 High School Years pack has made its debut, there are a ton of new things you can do in the game. One, in particular, is the option to partake in several clubs that will help you make your Sim excel in their future career. So, here’s a list of all after-school activities you can do in this latest exclusive.
I’d love for there to be more after school activities for the child and teen sims, but until then, you can technically make after school activities of your own, if you own Sims 4: Get Together. The Get-Together expansion pack allows you to create and customize clubs, which can be a great way to get sims out of the house, socializing, and pursuing interests.
After school activities are a great way to enhance your Sims 4 gameplay without putting in too much effort. I especially love after school activities for busy families. If you’ve ever tried to play with a family with energetic toddlers and child or teen teens, plus hold down jobs for the parents, you know how hectic it can get.
So, there you have it, these are all the after-school activities of The Sims 4 High School years pack. Before you go, you can discover more information about the game by looking at the relevant links below and checking out our guide on all the new Create A Sim items from this latest debut.

And if you want to make the very most of after school activities in Sims 4, I highly recommend buying the Sims 4 Parenthood game pack. This pack adds after school activities, as well as an enhanced responsibility system that ties into parenting and overall family gameplay.
If you’re wondering where all the after school activities for The Sims 4, you will find them all here! If you didn’t know after school activities were a fantastic feature in The Sims 3. They allowed your kid and teen Sims to join clubs or have a job once their school ended for the day. What made the school activities additionally great was that they helped your Sims develop as healthy individuals. So, we’re happy to announce that these activities are back in The Sims 4, and you can enjoy all these benefits again!
These after school activities are a fantastic opportunity for your younger Sims to grow up and be better versions of themselves. All of them start at 4pm, and they’re active every day of the week, except the weekend. And you’re left free to choose which one you want to join!
Of course, here we’re talking about the After School Activities Mod for The Sims 4 by kawaiistacie. This is one of the fantastic mods that you can find on the internet, and it’s such an intricate and well-designed feature that we absolutely love. It fits perfectly into our children and teen Sims’ lifestyle, so we recommend you to give it a shot as well. To get The Sims 4 after school activities mod by kawaiistacie, click here to download it!

## Create a sims 4 after school time event.

To join an After School Activity just go to your child or teen Sims’ Smart Phone. Select the Career/Household button at the bottom of the phone screen and then click Join After School Activity. Once your Sim starts to use the phone you will get a pop up asking which activity they would like to join.
There will be several afterschool activity opportunities, especially when the classes are about to end. These opportunities should be initiated manually by clicking on the exact location, or else they may simply drop out of the queue and be missed by the Sim.
The playable school events mod by Kawaii Stacie is a fun one! This mod allows you to go to school with your sims. This doesn’t make it happen for everyday, but you get to choose specific days that you want the event to take place, giving you full control.
The after-school activity will end when teen Sims are about to age up. There will be an award ceremony at the school which all of the teens' household members are supposed to attend. They will be given an award which can be found in the Sim's inventory.
If you have The Sims 4: Discover University you’ll definitely want this mod. It will allow you to let teenagers go to University if they meet a requirement. This can be any sim with a genius trait, or a sim who finished elementary school with an A or currently have an A in high school.
The quit or rejoin school mod by Triplis gives your sims the option to quit school at any time, without making it so they aren’t able to rejoin if they want. This is nice because it can make is so you can have a few days off school and then reenter whenever you choose.
You should use the Sims 4 Go to School mod as the best school tool for the game. The first thing you need to do is to download and install the actual mod. Second, you’ll need to place one of the two new avenues on a lot. And third, you’ll need to send your Sims to attend school!
Answer: The drama club in Sims 4 is an afterschool program but you can send your other sims to attend a performance in Del Sol Valley (the world that comes with Get Famous). If you own the Get Famous expansion pack and have a sim enrolled in the drama club, you can send a sim to a performance by selecting choices under the drama club menu.
