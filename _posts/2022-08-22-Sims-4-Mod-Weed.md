## Sims 4 is a popular video game that lets players control the lives of virtual characters.

Role-Playing Game: The Sims is seldom referred to as one, but it definitely is a Role Playing Game. It is based entirely around RPG Elements like attributes, skills, experience, personality traits and quirks, dialogue and relationships with other characters, diverse inventory and powerful customization tools. Some expansion packs (such as The Sims 3: World Adventures) even go that extra step by adding actual dungeons and combat into the mix, but these are played in just the same way as a Sim's regular work day followed by some dinner and a movie - and sometimes a regular work day can still be more challenging!

There are so many wonderful reality television shows that you can turn into a fun challenge in The Sims 4. The Big Brother Challenge is an awesome one for you to play through in the game and you’ll have a group of people being stuck inside of a home with no access to the outside world.
The Sims Mobile (6 March 2018), another free-to-play app similar to the above, but using assets from The Sims 4 and with a game-play style more focused on storytelling and community interaction. This has not replaced The Sims Freeplay - both are still available to download and receiving regular updates.
The Sims 4 (September 2, 2014). EA and Maxis have said that this iteration of the Sims series celebrates "the heart and soul of the Sims themselves" and have the Sims show more personality than in previous installments; this was eventually executed by having all Sims have an overall "mood" which enhances their facility at certain interactions and slows down others. The game will feature new tools to customize worlds and share them with others. Unlike SimCity (2013), the game is a single-player offline experience, although you do need an Internet connection to play it anyway—to appease its Copy Protection (which is based on Origin), and to connect to the "community" (which allows you to upload sims and houses to EA's servers, which would then make it available to other players for download).
The Sims 4 has helped me cope with quarantine, but I've been a fan of the series since I was young. In these games, you design a person, build them a house, and then take care of their every need. You can get your dream job and become a rocket scientist, make friends (or enemies), and even cheat your way to riches.

Romance is a big part of The Sims 4 since it is a life simulator and finding and losing love is a huge part of life. These sims 4 challenges are focused on romance whether it be falling in love with one sim, or falling in love and breaking the hearts of 100 sims, you’ll definitely find something you’ll enjoy.
The Sims Freeplay (December 15, 2011) An app game similar to The Sims 2 in gameplay but with The Sims 3 assets, and the FarmVille formula. Worth mentioning because they actually managed to alleviate the microtransactions criticism by finding a happy medium between the Farmville formula and single player gaming (the in game currency, simoleon, is easy to get, and Life Points can be earned from watching ads, hitting certain achievements, or even just completing tasks, instead of through exclusively buying them with real cash, and the wait time between actions is actually reasonable compared to many other games out in the market). The game has seen dozens of updates and new contents- many available for free or via regular simoleons if you completed the given tasks in a limited time before becoming only available via Life Points.
The Sims 4 base game comes with minimal amounts of drama, sure you can cheat on your partner or fight the old lady down the street, but what about when you want really juicy storylines. Drama mods are perfect for creating in-depth storylines and truly fleshing out your characters, it adds a sense of reality to sometimes unrealistic gameplay. This list will countdown the top 10 best drama mods.
Survival Sandbox: Believe it or not, the series can be thought of as an antecedent to/parody of this. While it completely lacks a combat mechanic beyond getting into harmless fights with other Simsnote Unless you're playing The Sims Medieval, or with one of the many mods that add violence, weapons, and murder to the game, it still requires players to closely observe and manage their Sims' wants, needs, and relationships, and if they don't have a way of making money, they're not paying for food or keeping a roof over their heads. With few exceptionsnote The PlayStation 2 port of the first game, The Sims: Bustin' Out, The Sims Stories, The Urbz, and the StrangerVille expansion for The Sims 4, there is no storyline other than that which the player forges for their Sims; the gameplay and narratives are entirely emergent. Later games even let you fish, grow a garden, and pick wild plants, which you can then sell or use to cook meals and brew herbal recipes. In short, it takes many of the tropes of the survival sandbox genre and applies them to suburban life.

## Some players have created mods that let them control cannabis plants in the game.

Over the past eighteen years, The Sims has become one of the most successful computer games of all time. It has millions of users building virtual houses, filling them up with virtual furniture, plants, animals, and other stuff, and controlling the lives of the billions of simulated, or 'Sim,' people who live there. And just like real life consumer culture, these Sims can get more and more new stuff with downloadable mods created by other users. Now, finally, your Sims can have cannabis, thanks to the Basemental mod, created by a modder called Filip. Herb.co interviewed him, to find out exactly how he did it.
The Sims 4 drug mode allows players to grow, smoke, and sell weed. If you want your Sim to consume cannabis in many ways, this article is the perfect guide for you, as we will teach you how to smoke weed in The Sims 4 and discuss the different ways to cure weed.
The most prominent feature of the mod is its range of drugs for sims to experiment with. The list includes cannabis (weed), tobacco, cocaine, amphetamine, shrooms, MDMA, ayahuasca, xanax, lean, adderall, LSD, and steroids. The mod also includes edits to mixology that adds new drink recipes, as well as the ability for sims to become drunk, and even alcoholics. The drugs are acquired in differing and semi-realistic ways, with not all being available for purchase in buy mode. The only drugs available in buy mode are cocaine, amphetamine, MDMA, and tobacco. Cannabis seeds are included for gardening (incorrectly categorized in Indoor Plants, rather than with the other seed packets in Outdoor Activities), as well as rolling papers, weed curing jars, and bongs. Drugs can form addictions (which will result in an addiction moodlet for the affected sim), and repeated use of drugs in a short period of time can result in a sim's death by overdose. If WickedWhims is installed, sims can pay dealers for drugs with sex. A sim or household that frequently sells drugs may be subject to police busts or swat raids, in which they will be taken to jail and have their inventory items confiscated.
There are ten strains of cannabis: Pure strains Northern Lights, Trainwreck, OG Kush, AK-47, Sour Diesel, Purple Haze; and hybrids Sour OG, Purple Lights, OG Wreck and Purple AK-47. If no dealers exist yet in the world, gardening is the only way to acquire cannabis. Once 15 uncured buds are harvested from a cannabis plant, they can be cured in a weed jar. The cured buds can then be rolled into a joint or put into a bong, hookah, or vaporizer, or baked into edibles. Sims high on cannabis will get a dazed moodlet.
In The Sims 4, you can become an astronaut, make friends with ghosts or turn into a vampire. One thing you can’t do is smoke weed, which is why one player has spent months working on a mod to bring that and other drugs to the game. He’s earning thousands of dollars in donations for his work.
He found drug-themed clutter objects, like lines of cocaine or bongs, but none of them were usable. Although he didn’t have too much programming experience, he wondered if he could modify those objects so that they’d be more than just decorational. During a call, he told me that he started with making a mod that allowed a Sim to snort a line of cocaine that he’d downloaded, and then it just grew from there.
G-Rated Drug: Has popped up here and there among the many games in the series, although the most frequently appearing one is a thinly veiled disguise for alcohol simply referred to as "juice". You can buy bars in most of the games and mix the "juices" yourself, and they cause "special moodlets" and effects in the sims who drink it (making them more flirty, energized, etc). In terms of references to other drugs, there are "herbs" you can grow in University Life that are pretty obvious nods to weed.
The nefarious means of buying weed include purchasing uncured buds from local drug dealers and using the dark web. Similarly, in the buy mode, the buds can be cured in a jar, and 48 hours later, bags of weed can be obtained from these jars. These bags can be opened from the inventory by clicking on them.
