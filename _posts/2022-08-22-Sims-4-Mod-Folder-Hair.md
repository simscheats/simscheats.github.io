## How to create a sims 4 mod folder hair.

Yeah it can be hard to sort. I would suggest keeping the pictures that comes with some of the hair and name them the same, then you can easily see what's what. Or download SimStudio in there you can open up the hair and see how it looks and then delete it from there.

Some of the CC you download may not work and in most cases, you are missing a mesh for the CC. When you are downloading it ensure you download the mesh along with it. For example, if it says, "This hair needs mesh." You would first type the name of the hair into your browser, for example, google chrome. Then you would locate the mesh and download it when you download the mesh for the hair, it will work and will not turn your sim bald or into a demon.
There are several ways you can organize your Mods folder. I like to do mine by categories, as seen in the picture above. This doesn't really do anything special during the gameplay, but it allows me to easily find content in my folders, install new content, and delete or update old content.
The following are sites that are well-known for hosting CC and Mods. I want to say that I'm not responsible for anything you see or that happens as a result of using these sites. I'm putting those we're all most familiar with up top, as they're in general the best places to go to download things for Sims. Many creators have their own blogs, and they're worth following if you like their work. The two big sites up front here host many items though, and should be visited by anyone interested in expanding their game. You can then explore people's tumblr/wordpress blogs and find creators whose work you enjoy, follow them, and enjoy a better Sims game. Some CC creators specialize in hair, others clothing and some make a mix of everything.
Once you’re in the “Create a Household” screen, click over to the “Hair” section. If you’re having trouble finding the custom content you’ve downloaded, click the small arrow next to “Feminine,” click content, and check the box next to “Custom Content” so that the hair section shows only custom content you’ve downloaded. You can enable this filter on all screens, even in Build/Buy!

If you want to have Sub-folders in you mods folder make sure you have the file Resource.cfg. And if you don't you can create one using Notepad++ And you would type everything like this Priority 500 PackedFile *.package PackedFile */*.package PackedFile */*/*.package PackedFile */*/*/*.package PackedFile */*/*/*/*.package PackedFile */*/*/*/*/*.package
If you are anything like me, you like to have a lot of custom content or mods. In this case, you may want to organize your mod folder. This can be down by creating new folders inside the mod folder. But be careful as some mods can only be 1–2 folders deep inside the mod folder, if it is any deeper the mod will not work, but CC is different that can be 4+ folders deep in the mod folder.
In the Mods folder, create a Mods Tutorial (any name will suffice) subfolder and move all of the “.package” files from the downloads folder into the Mods Tutorial folder. CC that appears in the “Create a Household” screen (clothes, hair, accessories, etc.) will be stored in the “CAS” folder, Build/Buy CC should go in the “Build Buy Mods” folder, and so on.
Custom content, or “Mods,” is additional assets and behaviors created by other players for the purpose of enriching the game beyond the base game that Maxis has published. This content often includes clothes for your Sims, traits, aspirations, and much more. Custom content is created and tested by users—it’s a big part of the Sims community.

## How to install a sims 4 mod.

Once the file has downloaded, extract it if necessary. Now we will need to locate The Sims 4 mod folder. This can be done by finding your documents, then Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4, then in this folder there should be a folder called ‘Mods.’ Simply drag and drop the file you have downloaded into the Mods folder.
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
Remember that game mods and custom content are designed to work with genuine versions of The Sims 4. There is no guarantee that they will work with pirated versions of the game, so if you do have a pirated version and a mod isn't working, that could be why. The only way to fix this would be to buy a copy of The Sims 4 directly from Origin, where you can ensure the game will be patched regularly and compatible with all mods and custom content.
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
