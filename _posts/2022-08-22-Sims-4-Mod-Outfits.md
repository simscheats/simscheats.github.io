Download Sim body texture templates (optional). These weird looking image textures are used to map out where your clothing textures are placed on your Sims. There are four different image templates and UV maps. One for female Sims, male Sims, toddlers, and child Sims. While we won't be using these for this tutorial, you may decide you want to use them for more advanced options as you get better as creating clothing for your Sims. You can download these images on The Sims 4 Studio forum.
Another way to change your Sims’ work outfit is to use a mod called “Plan Career Outfit.” The mod adds interactions to all dressers, Get Together closets, and mirrors. It can also be incorporated into any object that already features the Change Sim interactions, meaning it’ll automatically work with Custom Content creations.
Custom content is the best way to really customize your experience in The Sims 4 and make your characters look so much more interesting than vanilla EA clothes. These packs are awesome because they’re curated collections of clothing that work really well together and can be used for so many different sims!
And the last step is to type the actual Sims 4 copy outfit cheat line, which is outfits.copy_outfit. Now, because there are several outfit categories (e.i. Format, Swimwear, Everyday, Athletic), you’ll need to insert a number at the end of the cheat line.

Changing outfits isn’t always the most fun idea. Sure, having all kinds of different outfits for all the different situations is cool. But it’s also a lot of work! So having to choose an appropriate outfit for every possible occasion isn’t the dream of many simmers. And sometimes, they just want to use one outfit for multiple different occasions. So how do you copy outfits in The Sims 4 and reuse them in other outfit slots?
That’s everything you need to know about Sims 4 custom content. If you’re looking for general Sims 4 mods, we’ve got an excellent guide for that. We’ve also got a Sims 4 cheats list if you’re looking for some help running your sim’s lives. Failing that, why not read up on what we want from The Sims 5, should Maxis decide to give us another iteration.
