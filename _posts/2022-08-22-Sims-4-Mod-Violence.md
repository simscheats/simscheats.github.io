Though the mod is completely not safe for work, videos of YouTubers playing their copies of the game with this mod still rack up views in the thousands. There’s definitely an appeal to it, especially seeing as the creator of the mod, Ahmed Qoqas, makes bank by creating violence-themed mods along with maintaining the Extreme Violence Mod.
The creators have tried to make this murdering Mod as realistic as possible. This Mod is a script mod, so it does not clash or interfere with any other game functions, making the game run smoothly and sufficiently. It hardly ever has a problem with conflicts or overriding as the users control all the game functions. In the same fashion, it does not perform any process without the guidance of the player.
