Even if you are someone who might prefer a bit of a tamer or more diluted style, there are both independent tops and bottoms, as well as set pieces like a hoodie and sweatpants that anyone can sport, regardless of which fashion trends your Sim pioneers.
This category of clothes contains basically dresses and swimwear. Men have serviceable suits and swim trunks, so they’re getting a pass in this section. While there are a lot of cute dresses, The Sims 4 can’t keep up with the speed of fashion, no matter how many expansions they release. swimwear for women was a little bit more dire—in the base game, there was no happy medium between “frumpy” and “thot.” These outfits can make your Sims feel more trendy
Something that I’d love to see more of in The Sims 4 is bodysuits so that we can have more options for tucking into jeans or skirts that actually look great. It’s so fun to wear and they look great and this monster body suit is a great piece of cc clothing.
The overall shorts are the secret summer weapons of every woman! Or, it should be so! Because it is an absolutely cute look that you can take anywhere! Glaza has created many versions for The Sims 4 and you should visit her blog to check them all in detail and download these awesome sims 4 outfit mods!

## Some of these clothes are suitable for everyday wear, and others are more formal or fashionable.

Nice shorts and a simple shirt – is there a better way to dress up? It’s certainly hard to disagree when looking at such fantastic examples! In this pack, you’ll find combinations for both everyday and formal use, so it’s really an invaluable CC to have! To download it, click here.
Fashionable women's clothing styles shed some of the extravagances of previous decades (so that skirts were neither crinolined as in the 1850s, nor protrudingly bustled in back as in the late 1860s and mid-1880s, nor tight as in the late 1870s), but corseting continued unmitigated, or even slightly increased in severity. Early 1890s dresses consisted of a tight bodice with the skirt gathered at the waist and falling more naturally over the hips and undergarments than in previous years. Puffy leg-of-mutton sleeves (also known as gigot sleeves) made a comeback, growing bigger each year until reaching their largest size around 1895.
Unfussy, tailored clothes, adapted from the earlier theme of men's tailoring and simplicity of form, were worn for outdoor activities and traveling. The shirtwaist, a costume with a bodice or waist tailored like a man's shirt with a high collar, was adopted for informal daywear and became the uniform of working women. Walking suits featured ankle-length skirts with matching jackets. The notion of "rational dress" for women's health was a widely discussed topic in 1891, which led to the development of sports dress. This included ample skirts with a belted blouse for hockey. In addition, cycling became very popular and led to the development of "cycling costumes", which were shorter skirts or "bloomers" which were Turkish trouser style outfits. By the 1890s, women bicyclists increasingly wore bloomers in public and in the company of men as well as other women. Bloomers seem to have been more commonly worn in Paris than in England or the United States and became quite popular and fashionable. In the United States, bloomers were more intended for exercise than fashion. The rise of American women's college sports in the 1890s created a need for more unencumbered movement than exercise skirts would allow. By the end of the decade, most colleges that admitted women had women's basketball teams, all outfitted in bloomers. Across the nation's campuses, baggy bloomers were paired with blouses to create the first women's gym uniforms.
These clothes feature a gorgeous puffy sleeve top with a small crop and a nice tie in the center and has a matching skirt that work absolutely beautifully together. The creator (Grafity) has even made 20 different swatches so these look great on all sorts of skin tones and body types.
McLayneSims' clothing isn't only for men though, as they also focus on creating clothing for boys as well. If you're also looking for some party-wear, there's plenty of costumes, fancy suits, and stereotypical 'character'-wear for you to choose from as well.
Most of their pieces are inspired by currently trending styles, from retro bell-bottom jeans and their return to the modern sweaters and cardigans, which guarantees that there will always be something in their catalog that will fit you and your Sim's personal taste.
The shift toward functional fashion also affected women's athletic wear. Women in Paris began wearing bloomers when bicycling as early as 1893, while in England lower bicycle frames accommodated the dresses that women continued to wear for bicycling. Long floor length dresses gradually gave way to shorter hemlines and a more casual style of athletic clothing. Similarly, bathing suits also became shorter and less covered — yet another example of the beginnings of a shift in dress toward greater freedom and functionality.
The less formal dinner jacket or tuxedo, which featured a shawl collar with silk or satin facings, now generally had a single button. Dinner jackets were appropriate formal wear when "dressing for dinner" at home or at a men's club. The dinner jacket was worn with a white shirt and a dark tie.
