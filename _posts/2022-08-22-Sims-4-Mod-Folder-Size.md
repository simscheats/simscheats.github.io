## Sims 4 mod folder size is large.

or instead you can copy your mods folder to your desk top to make a copy and then delete the mods folder that is in your Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4. Do not delete the copy you put on your desktop or you will lose all of your mods and custom content.

So basically you have have like 260 gb of storage on you actual Mac,numbers may differ, but you only have 5 gb of iCloud storage. You store all your cc in the "Documents" folder, and that is in iCloud Drive. Basically ALL your mod and custom content are saved onto your iCloud Drive. Custom content takes up A LOT of space, and the base game takes up around 600-700 mb/ So when you dowloaded all those mods you then ran out of the 5mb of storage space that you had. Theres no real solution but to buy more iCloud storage, I just quit playing the Sims 4. .
@SantaFeAtBay You can delete the mods fully by opening your Sims 4 folder in My Documents and in the mod folder delete all mods, in your case you can just delete the entire folder. You will then need to clear the Sims 4 cache which you can do by deleting the file localthumbscache.package which is the folder in which your Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/ cache can be found.You also need to delete all files that end in .cache but leave the actual directory. Now go ahead and go back to thecachestr folder. Delete all of the files but once again do not delete the actual directory.If you see a folder called onlinethumbnailcache then you can go ahead and trash it too.
@dunstz Here is another great article about organizing and maintaining mods and CC:https://simscommunity.info/2018/08/08/the-sims-4-how-to-ensure-a-healthy-game/2/@Psychotps I think the default number of sub-folders for .package files is 5 levels deep unless you edit your Resource.cfg file.EDIT: @Psychotps I meant to add awesome post on Mods folder organization and maintenance!
Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.

The Mods FolderNext, find or create the Mods folder. It should already be there, but if it's not you can right click in the white area within The Sims 4 folder and create a folder, being sure to name it Mods. The game automatically recognizes and attempts to utilize anything in this folder. So, once we download CC, we'll copy the files to that folder. Tip: You can have other folders inside the Mods folder, so if you'd like to separate out your CC and Mods in to separate folders, or even categorize them by object/clothing type, you can do so! Additionally, Forum member RandyH notes that it's possible to rename mods so long as you keep the .package at the end of the file name. This can make your organization even simpler, and possibly help you track things down easier. All of this is actually a good idea should you run into a mod or piece of CC that gives you trouble, so that it's easier to find and remove.
Forgot to mention after you delete the mods folder then run your game as normal and it will create the Resource.cfg. and then you can exit the game and copy all your custom content and mods back into the mods folder.. Before you do that you can create folders to keep things organized. But keep scripts and mods in the main folder and just put the custom content into folders
Help! I deleted my Sims mod file long ago and it never reappeared. I never saw any Sim with those hairstyle or clothes. Everything was great.Suddenly it reappeared! I got the warning blurb when I logged into Sims 4.I don't need or want those mods or any mods. How do I delete it? I've looked everywhere. I can't find it.Now my Sims game just flashes and flashes. Not lightning flashes. Error flashes. I cannot play it as the screen keeps jerking with these flashes. Please help me find and delete this file.
I have a TON of space on my Macbook Air. I downloaded a plethora of mods last night and most of them are not loaded into the game. The EA folder says “Out of Space” and then says “Out of Space” underneath the Mods Folder. I even upgraded my icloud space to accomdate. Please help!

## Sims 4 mod folder size is smaller.

Ahhh, that makes sense. I went into my mods folder to see the size of everything and it all varied drastically between cc files of the same category. Though, most of my CAS items were 1,000 KB and above, while the build/buy CC I have just goes up from 1KB, lol. And of the 3,000+ files I have, 2,186 of them are build/buy objects, so I suppose that's why my folder is smaller.
@dunstzWhat I would do is copy your entire Mods folder somewhere. Make a backup and then delete the original Mods folder. Make sure you have a good backup beforehand! You can also just Move the Mods folder somewhere like your Desktop.Then just run the game and try to start a NEW GAME. If everything loads up fine, then you have a bad mod somewhere in your Mods folder. You'll just have to figure out which one.
Hi I know How to download mods and I do put my CC in the mods folder. However when I launch my game it comes up with the mods list (as it should) and shows all the CC I downloaded but then when I go to the actual create a Sim some of my CC don't show up?
What are ModsMods are game modifications to the Sims 4, pure and simple. Practically any game that is moddable has mods. They may enhance a feature, or introduce entirely new features. Mod creators work hard to make sure their content is stable and adds the functionality that is described when they share it with the Sims community. Some mods greatly enhance gameplay, make minor adjustments to how things work (like how often objects break), or simply fix something that irritates a lot of players. Mod creators sometimes fix bugs before EA does, and may at times be more in tune with the community's desires for how something should work. For example, door locks were released in a patch, but first came in the form of a mod.
Same here, mostly. I also leave my script mods in zip files in the main folder. In fact, the game will automatically detect any .zip files it finds as script mods, whether they are intended to be or not. Other kind of archive files however, like .7z or .rar the game doesn't detect at all.
Script mods are a special type of Mod that must remain inside a zip file in order to work. You must also go to the game options menu (ESC Game Options Other Script Mods Allowed) to enable them. You can see this section in the menu in the screenshot further up where you also enable normal Mods and CC.
Well, my question is probably a repeated one because i still can't figure out why my downloaded stuff doesn't show up in the game. yes, I already put them in the Mods folder and they all show up in the script when i open the game. if you answer 'turn on the enable cc' please give me a screenshot because i can't find the enable cc .
I have downloaded tons of custom content from thesimsresource, moved them to my mods folder, and when i open my game they work fine. however, when i did the same with lots and moved them to my tray folder ALL of my content in GONE from my gallery when i start my game. Help!
