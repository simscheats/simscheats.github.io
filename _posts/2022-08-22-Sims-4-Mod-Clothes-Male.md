Switching up work clothing in Sims 4 can be tricky, as the game itself doesn’t allow this feature. Luckily, you can use a cheat code to overcome this obstacle called “Change Career Outfit.” It enables you to implement all your attire ideas to make your Sims’ career more attractive.
Another way to change your Sims’ work outfit is to use a mod called “Plan Career Outfit.” The mod adds interactions to all dressers, Get Together closets, and mirrors. It can also be incorporated into any object that already features the Change Sim interactions, meaning it’ll automatically work with Custom Content creations.
All content relating to a Sim’s visuals, from skinstones down to accessories and clothing, will be in Create-A-Sim mode. Downloaded objects will be viewable in Buy and Build Mode, which you can filter by custom content only by heading to ‘Filter Items’ on the right hand side, selecting ‘Content’, and then ticking ‘custom content’ from the drop down menu.
