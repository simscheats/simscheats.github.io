## Sims 4 mod zodiac traits

The Zodiac Signs Mod, shout out to the mod creator Radiophobe, allows your sims to have horoscope signs again, similar to the Sims 2 and 3! Is your sim an Aries, Libra, Taurus, Cancer? You can now choose a sign through the rewards in aspirations and it gives your sims specific traits, buffs, and whims according to that sign (without taking up a third slot in your traits)! Your sim will also be capabilities with other NPCs, who are also assigned random zodiac signs! Check out which signs are compatible and which whims come with each sign on the mod download page below!

When your sim has a zodiac trait unlocked, they will occasionally get whims for their zodiac sign ,each zodiac trait will correspond to your sim’s zodiac trait and will each trait will give off a negative and positive whim, like :Meet someone new (by being a Leo) and Get into a fight (by being a Scorpio).
The frequency of these whims will differ and will appear at random occasions throughout your sim’s life, these ‘zodiac’ goals already exist in the game, they will have the default satisfaction point award as it is in the game, so the goals for the custom whims already exist in the game, and the zodiac trait won’t overwrite any existing whims that already exist in the game. In the future I might add custom goals to whims . Look at the end of the description for all whims!
Capricorn sims crave stability and have a very high work
ethic. They’re very career-oriented. They rarely apologize and rarely forgive
you if you’ve done wrong to them. They’re very blunt and usually great with
money. They usually just spend money on things that they really want. They hate
doing favors for people unless you’re very important to them. They love asking
for favors but hate when you ask for one.
Step 4: Extract Rar file (using recommended free7-Zip), by right clicking on the rar file, going into "7-Zip", and clicking "Extract here,." There should now be a folder called,"MTS_Radiophobe_1926389_Radiophobe_RewardTrait_ZodiacSigns-1.1" move it to your mods folder:

Throughout the past few months, I haven’t gotten a chance to truly test the updated traits. Releasing traits that I haven’t been able to test in game wouldn’t be ethical. Because of this, I decided to put a few weeksnaside to test the traits. Throughout the following few weeks, I will be updating and posting the updated versions of the traits.
Three castmates were born in the summer, and they all share the same zodiac sign. Angelina Pivarnick, Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino, and Paul DelVecchio Jr. are Cancers. Angelina's birthday is June 26, while Mike and Pauly D are just a day apart, with July 4 and July 5 birthdays, respectively. Cancers have many great traits. They are compassionate and caring spirits, and they are loyal. While Mike and Pauly tend to portray these characteristics more than Angelina, she still fits the Cancer mold. Angelina was very concerned about the feelings of her husband after the drama went down at their 2019 wedding. While she may have found the infamous bridesmaids' speech to be funny at first, once she realized that her husband was offended, she cared more about his feelings than her own. The downsides of Cancer are moodiness and vindictiveness.
With a gift like super-hearing, it's no wonder that Dolores best fits the Zodiac sign of Gemini. Gemini is the communicator of the Zodiac, loving to gather information and able to process it faster than any other Zodiac member. Dolores' own ability in Encanto is super-hearing, making her the secret keeper of the family.
Camilo is the shapeshifter of the family, easily flowing from one form to the next without pause. This is best exemplified in the free-flowing, non-conforming nature of the Aquarius sign. This Zodiac sign usually embodies a rebellious sort of spirit while also doing its best to maintain close and caring bonds within the community.

## Zodiac signs in the sims 4

When creating a new Sim in The Sims and The Sims 2, the Sim will be given the Zodiac sign that's closest to the personality that was chosen. As the player assigns and reassigns personality points, the display will change to show which sign the Sim will have with that mix of points. Zodiac signs returned in The Sims 3: Late Night and in patch 17. They do not affect a Sim's personality or lifestyle.
Zodiac signs returned in The Sims 3: Late Night and are carried forward with patch 17. They have no effect on personality or lifestyle, but they do make it easier to have contact with people of certain zodiac signs. For example, a Pisces will be attracted to a Scorpio, Cancer, Capricorn, Virgo and Taurus.
There are some premade Sims with mismatched zodiac signs which are different from the common mismatches listed above. An example of this is Patrizio Monty who is a Sagittarius but has the personality of a Cancer rather than a Libra while Nervous Subject is an Aquarius but had the personality of a Virgo (if its crawled through boolprop testingcheatsenabled true by the player) rather than a Sagittarius as well.
In real life, a person's zodiac sign (also called an astrological sign) is determined by their date of birth. Thus, two people born on the same day will share a zodiac sign. In-game, however, Sims may be born on the same day but have different signs, since a Sim's sign is determined by their personality and not by their birth date.
Sims will generally get on well with other Sims who have the same sign, because they are attracted to others with similar personalities. However, personality and zodiac are separate contributors to chemistry, because Sims will keep the same sign even if their personality points are altered. "Attracted to" and "disgusted by" are not absolutes, but modifiers that help or hinder the growth of a relationship. Sims with incompatible signs can become good friends, and even lovers, if they have enough else in common. However, it'll take longer, and they'll have to work at it harder. Likewise, Sims with compatible signs but little else in common will have trouble building a relationship, and may even end up becoming enemies.
In The Sims and The Sims 2, there is a preset personality for each Zodiac sign. In The Sims, a player who wants a Sim to have a specific sign can cycle through them by clicking on the part of the display that shows what the Sim's Zodiac sign would be. In The Sims 2, the Sim will initially be given a random Zodiac sign and the associated personality. Players can change this by clicking on the symbol for the Zodiac sign they want the Sim to have. In both games, the preset personality for a sign is a starting point; players can reassign personality points as they see fit. Personality traits affect not only the things Sims prefer to do, but also their relationships. In The Sims 3 personality points were replaced by a system of traits, which Sims either do or do not have.
Aries are the most honest sign in the entire zodiac, but
loooovveee to have things go their way. Aries sims are some crazy sims and have
severe anger management issues and also have jealousy issues. They hate being
disrespected and have a slight sense of entitlement. However, they are loving
people. Aries are very competitive and talented. They try to be the best at
anything that they can do.
The Sim will be able to learn new behaviors or become closer to another zodiac sign in personality but still maintain its original sign, such as Tara DeBateau having the Leo sign but her personality is exactly the same as that of a pre-created Gemini. The justification is that these traits are learned and passed genetically from parents to children, but in this case Tara is an adopted child. This happens with most playable Sims in Pleasantview, Strangetown, Veronaville, and Belladonna Cove where their signs are different from its original, such as Jessica Peterson being a Libra sign and having the personality traits of a Create a Sim Leo.
