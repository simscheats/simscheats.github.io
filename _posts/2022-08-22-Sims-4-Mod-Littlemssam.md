## The sims 4 mod "littlemssam" lets you control your sims' emotions.

But with the Emotional Interia mod by roBurky your sims will behave and act in a more lifelike way. What this means is that sims’ moods will be prolonged so you’ll need to put in a bit more effort to change their frame of mind. This mod can be challenging, but roBurky explains that “the aim is to make emotions feel a little more meaningful, to make your sims a little more human.” You’ll need to put more thought into the small things in life that could make your sim happy, like talking to friends, doing a hobby they love, or eating a really tasty grilled cheese.

If you're fed up with your Sims having meaningless chit-chats with each other, then this mod from PolarBearSims (opens in new tab) could be just the ticket to spice up their interactions. This extensive mod introduces many changes, but one of the key features is removing idle chat from conversations. This means that instead of nattering, your Sims will have to interact with each other, and the mod will decide how this goes down based on the existing relationship between the Sims, plus their character traits and current mood. Sit back and watch how things pan out, but prepare for fireworks if two Sims don't get along.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
Tired of watching your sims change their moods every ten seconds? The Meaningful Stories mod from roBurky (opens in new tab) gives your Sims deeper, long-lasting, and more realistic emotions. Your Sim can become depressed for days after a breakup or feel intense happiness after a first kiss. You won't be able to change a Sim's sad mood by simply putting him in a nicely decorated room. Although influencing your Sims becomes more difficult with the Meaningful Stories mod, everything that happens in their lives becomes more meaningful.
You can find many mods over at ModTheSims, which hosts a wealth of community-made free mods for you to download and enjoy as you please. Installing mods is simple enough – all you need to do is drag the mod files over to the game’s mod folder. In a typical setup, this should be Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.

And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?
Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.
For mod fans who really want to get into the nitty-gritty details of playing The Sims then check out the MC Command Centre mega-mod by Deaderpool. This mod is a collection of smaller mods that give you the power to make small adjustments and tweaks to how sims live their lives.
