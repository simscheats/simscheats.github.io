## Sims 4 mod omegaverse is a new mod for the sims 4 that allows players to explore the universe of the omegaverse.

Sims 4 Omegaverse's features are all linked to the two CAS traits which it adds, the Alpha and Omega trait. Any sim who is not either an alpha or an omega is considered to be a beta. There is some functionality of Omegaverse for betas, but it is generally limited to alphas and omega.

Omegaverses (OVs) started off as a trope within gay (MxM) erotica, however have since become quite a common universe in which to set a romance, especially since they allow from gay familial units, as well as some of the other unique features to OVs. As such, most OVs focus on men, with male alphas and male omegas, and it's somewhat rare for female alphas to be found (assuming there are women at all in the OV, as some completely remove them from their universe), and female omegas are almost unheard of in most media. But Sims 4 Omegaverse does allow either sex to be an alpha or an omega, so this primer will cover both.
The key thing to remember is that all OVs are unique to a creator, and some creators aren't even consistent with their OVs between setting universes. So an OV will usually follow these characteristics, but the specifics are often quite varied. Sims 4 Omegaverse is Jamjars' own OV which he has created for his own game. It's heavily inspired by OVs by Claire Cullen, in her books, however Jamjars has made changes where necessary (either for personal preference, or simply to allow it to fit more seamlessly with Sims 4 in general).
Here's another fantastic mod that adds extra layers to the overall gameplay experience of The Sims 4. Developed by a creator named Roburky, Meaningful Stories redesigns the mood and emotions system of The Sims 4 to make your Sims' lives feel more important and interesting.
With the mod installed, you'll see a lot more options and choices at every stage of the child-rearing process in The Sims 4. For example, when you're talking about your Sim's infant, you'll have a lot more conversational topics to choose from. And when you interact with the bassinette, your options there will be enhanced as well.

If you've ever thought that the parenting options in The Sims 4 are a little bit thin on the ground, this is most definitely a mod that you need to download. From a creator named Caradriel, Better Babies and Toddlers does exactly what it says on the tin – it makes major improvements in the baby and toddler department.
This is a basic primer of what an Omegaverse is. For more information, you can find a lot of articles throughout the web (such as those lists in 'Further Reading'), this is only a basic explanation, meant for the completely uninitiated in Omegaverses.
These changes don't just apply to adults, either. You'll notice that toddlers, cats and dogs also have more personality when this mod is installed, making the overall experience of The Sims 4 a lot more varied and interesting, especially when you're not in build mode.
We finally have the latest version of Omegaverse, and there are some big changes with this version (hence why it’s called “Overhaul” and it’s v2.0.0 rather than v1.6.0). The entire A/B/O assignment process has been overhauled, including new ways to assign A/B/O Status and huge amounts of customisation as to whether NPCs become Alphas, Betas, or Omegas.
