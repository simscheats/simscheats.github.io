## Sims 4 mod manager is a safe way to install and manage mods.

Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.

The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
If you ask why, then you’re on the right track to make your life a lot easier. You see, the Mod Manager is a quality of life, fully developed software that helps you organize all The Sims 4 files. If you’ve ever found yourself in the mess of all the additional mods and CC you download for the game, then this is your ticket out of that hell!
Mods can be a lot of fun to use & I have quite a few of them but they do require some special precautions.Be aware that outdated mods can break your game even without viruses. If you are going to use them, my advice is to only add a few at a time and keep careful notes on which ones you are adding and where you found them. This will make it easier to check for updates later on.After adding a mod, keep an eye out for anything that looks wrong in your game. If something looks wrong, stop playing and do not save. Immediately go back and delete the mod from your Mods folder and then delete the localthumbcache.package file from your Sims 4 folder (this is very important). In fact, you should delete that localthumbcache file every time you make any change to your Mods folder. No worries, the game will auto-generate a new cache file the next time you launch Sims 4.Also keep an eye out for Last Exceptions files in your Sims 4 folder as they can be a good indicator that you are using an outdated mod & it is causing script errors.Finally, make sure you temporarily remove all mods and CC prior to installing a game patch. This means you'll want to make sure that the "Automatic game updates" setting is disabled in Origin to allow you the chance to move out the mods before the patch downloads. Keep in mind that just because a mod has been working fine for a long time, it does not automatically mean it will still work after a game patch. Always check for mod updates after installing a game patch.There are a couple of broken mod/CC trackers that I use. One tracker is on the Sims 4 Forum that is posted by luthienrising:https://forums.thesims.com/en_US/discussion/968717/broken-updated-mods-cc-university-editionThe other tracker I use is on a site called Simsonic Sims:https://simsonic.weebly.com/mods.htmlIf all this sounds like a lot of work, well maybe it is, but it is nothing compared with trying troubleshoot and fix a game after it has been broken by an outdated mod.P.S. I usually use the sites @Psychotps mentioned :D
Anyone who uses Mods or Custom Content in The Sims 4, or even from any of previous The Sims games, will know that your Mods folder can sometimes feel a little overwhelming. However, GameTimeDev has created a program to help players keep their Mods folder organized.

“The Sims 4: How To Ensure a Healthy Game” by SrslySims: This article is a must read for any mod or CC user who has the basics of this article down but is looking for more advanced knowledge on how to further consolidate and organize their mods and CC. SrslySims goes over many things that are not covered in this basic guide for beginners, like merging your package files and removing special characters from file names in order to alleviate strain on performance.
The number one thing you need to know about mods is that they break. They break a LOT. After almost every single game update, in fact. This means that you’ll be redownloading your mods constantly. If this sounds like too much hassle for you, then mods are probably not for you. If you are willing to keep your Mods folder maintained on a regular basis, then continue reading!
After you install the program, the main framework that you’ll be using in it is called Manage Mods. If you click on it, an empty page will open up. Since you have just now installed it for the first time, you will need to import all of your mods and CC. That’s easily done through the little plus “+” button at the bottom left corner. But be aware that sometimes the program links to your Sims 4 folder, and if you already have mods and CC loaded to the game, they might appear on the page.
Sims 4 Studio: This program does a wide variety of things, but one of its functions is to manage and maintain custom content. You can use this program to merge/unmerge your package files and run batch fixes on incorrectly categorized CC. You will need to make an account on the forum in order to download, but it’s worth it. Being a member gives you access to comprehensive tutorials and support from knowledgeable users. Making an account is free.

## Sims 4 mod manager is a safe way to download and install mods.

Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
About Mods and Custom ContentMods and Custom Content are wildly popular among Sims 4 players, but if you're new to the franchise you may be unaware what treasures await those who ravenously scour the web for the latest downloads. There is far more free content available to download than is included in the base game and all game/stuff packs combined. In this guide, I'll teach you how to install CC and mods, explain what they are and offer some direction on where to go from here by providing links to sites where you can binge-download CC for your game.
FALSE. It is perfectly safe to download mods and CC. Creators will not stick malware or viruses into their downloads. Creators create content for the game out of a genuine passion for The Sims; however, many creators host their downloads on sites that have pop-up ads. These ads are often malicious in nature and trick you into thinking that you’re downloading mods and CC, when in fact, you’re downloading a virus. This can be easily avoided by installing AdBlocker for your browser. The AdBlocker extension will stop those ads from popping up in the first place, making browsing for your favourite mods and CC safe.
@Sophiexxxxxxxx There are literally thousands of places. TSR is one of the largest but you have to deal with the enormous amount of advertisements on the site. Mod the Sims is probably best for gameplay mods.As for viruses, you should always be careful downloading anything. But if the file you download ends in ".package", then it's very likely safe. I've never heard of a sims package file containing a virus.
This program is designed to help you bring order to your Sims 4 mod folder. It tries to extract thumbnails from the files or if that doesn't work, it searches for a thumbnail online. This is not always perfect, but helps to see what is included in a particular mod.
modthesims.info - Definitely my go-to, though I don't use CC heavily. Everything on MTS is totally free, and it's exceptionally well-organized. This makes for an easy browsing experience. They feature so much content that they are almost all you need in order to really beef up your game with CC. Of course, modthesims also has plenty of mods, and many of the best mod makers in The Sims community are members there.
Backing up Saved Games, Mods, and CCYou can backup your Mods and CC just as you can Save files, and it's smart to do this in case of disaster. Copy them to another drive or a USB stick and they're safe from hard drive failure. Head to your Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4 folder. Right click each of those three important folders - Saves, Tray, and Mods. Copy them then paste in a new location, where you know to find them. Should you have to reinstall the game or wipe everything, you've got a copy of your Sims families, and kept your collection of CC and Mods. These are precious because it takes time to build up a collection, and losing dozens of downloads can be a major nuisance.
The Mods FolderNext, find or create the Mods folder. It should already be there, but if it's not you can right click in the white area within The Sims 4 folder and create a folder, being sure to name it Mods. The game automatically recognizes and attempts to utilize anything in this folder. So, once we download CC, we'll copy the files to that folder. Tip: You can have other folders inside the Mods folder, so if you'd like to separate out your CC and Mods in to separate folders, or even categorize them by object/clothing type, you can do so! Additionally, Forum member RandyH notes that it's possible to rename mods so long as you keep the .package at the end of the file name. This can make your organization even simpler, and possibly help you track things down easier. All of this is actually a good idea should you run into a mod or piece of CC that gives you trouble, so that it's easier to find and remove.
