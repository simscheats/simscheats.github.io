This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn't exist, you can make your own, as long as it's in the same location.... see more ›

@Teenybober Do you know where your user data folder is? This Sims 4 folder, not the one with the game files but a separate folder in a different directory, stores saves, saved households and builds, screenshots, etc. as well as mods. The game itself should create a Mods folder by default there. In Windows and macOS, the user data is in Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4, although I have no idea if your setup would look different.If you're not sure where to find this content, load your game to the Main Menu, click Load Game, then hover over the folder icon under the name of your save. It will list the full file path to that save. So just find that same Sims 4 folder, and you should see a Mods folder inside.
As the original instructions say, the correct folder is in Documents\Electronic Arts. Be sure to start your game at least once, so that this Sims 4 folder will be created. And please remove the Mods folder you created from the Sims 4 folder in Program files (x86).... view details ›

Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.

This mods folder is exactly where all of your mods get stored, and therefore, it is quite a necessary attribute to the game.. The steps for sims 3 mods folder download are:. When you download any kinds of mods or cc’s in your game, they all immediately go into the mods folder and then get stored there.. This is so that you can use those mods whenever you want, simply by taking them from your mods folder.. In Sims 3, your mods folder is in your Sims three folder, documents \Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods.. To download mods in Sims 3, you need to have a monkey bar or a helper monkey to ensure that you have downloaded mods or cheats.. You need to make sure that your game accepts your mods, so click on your Sims three documents folder and then follow the steps below:. How to retrieve your mod from the compressed file: To retrieve your mod from a compressed file, you can use WinRAR or 7-zip.. How to shift the package files to your package folder: You can shift them into your package folder by extracting them and saving them into your Sims 3 document folder.. To find the right modifications, follow the steps below: NRaas website, Mod the Sims, Awesome Mod, TheSimsResource.com, and content blogs such as My S3 Blog.
Custom content and general mods: These files end in .package. Open the Mod folder the game has created (Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods) and copy all the mod files into the folder. You can create additional subfolders to organize your growing mod collection better.
@Teenybober--since it's been a little while, you probably have already found the folder following Puzzlez's instructions (and it's a faster way, that's for sure). but just in case, or perhaps as it might help someone else.when you install games through Lutris, it creates folders to simulate (or create a compatibility layer for) a Windows environment.the path will depend on where you told Lutris to install the game to. as an example, in your distro, it can be /home/(your user)/games/ts4.inside this folder, Lutris will create a 'virtual' c: drive, so it can also generate the Program Files folders (where Origin and The Sims install to) and other system files you'd find in a Windows installation.one of these folders will be 'users'. inside, you will find another one with your actual username. and in there you will find 'My Documents' which is where the Sims user data files will be stored, in Electronic Arts / The Sims 4. and that's where your Mods folder will be. (see, i told you Puzzlez's way was faster! )this is not the same Documents folder you already use in your distro. so for faster access, you can drag the Mods folder to your desktop, and choose to create a symlink when it prompts you. that way you don't have to click all the way to it again each time you want to change something.
@sofiafg10The game creates the Sims 4 folder in the Electronic Arts folder when you first launch it so if you have just installed the game it won't yet have been created. Also, do you have iCloud Drive enabled? If so then your Documents folder may be moved to the the cloud.

## Sims 4 mods not working

Finally, uninstalling and reinstalling the Sims 4 is the last resort to fix mods notworking problem. You can completely remove the Sims 4 from your computer and then download the latest version of the game from the official website. Then, install the game according to the given instruction and check if Sims 4 mods not showing up issue is removed.
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page.. If the mod page contains different mod versions, ensure your downloaded version corresponds with the game version.. Don’t forget to enable mods again after the update, as EA updates disable mods.. Make sure the downloaded mod version corresponds with your current game version and that you’ve made the necessary game updates.. Sometimes, the mods may not show up because you don’t have a mod folder or can’t find it to unzip the mod package.
We have received numerous reports regarding the issue where Sims 4 mods fail to work. Either the game doesn’t pick up the mod files which you have pasted in the directory or the mod fails to initialize. We looked at several user reports and use cases to come to the conclusion that this issue occurred due to several different reasons.
Lastly, if none of these step’s help, you may want to look online for users with a similar issue. Head to Sims 4 or EA Games forums and search for threads dedicated to that specific trait and the term “mod not working.” Perhaps, the issue is well-known, and The Sims 4 community has already found a solution.
In Sims 4, an option is provided to allow players to enable or disable the mods in game according to their needs. If this option is disabled, you will definitely experience Sims 4 mods not showing up issue. So, you should firstly check if mods are enabled in your Sims 4. To do that, you need to:
In this case, you should create a new household and check if it can load the mods. If Sims 4 mods not working issue disappear, it will be sure that this issue is caused by the household problem. You can give up the original household and use the new one.
Another thing to check is the mod compatibility with your current Sims 4 game. We came across several different cases where the mod author didn’t update the existing version of the mod to be compatible with the latest version of Sims which caused the mod to conflict and not work as expected. Navigate to the official mod website and check if the current version of the mod which you have been using is working properly in Sims 4. You can also take a look at different forums.
