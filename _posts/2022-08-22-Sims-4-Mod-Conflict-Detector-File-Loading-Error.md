## The sims 4 mod conflict detector file loading error is appearing.

Hello! so two weeks ago I was playing sims 4 and so I decided I wanted to do a few cc shopping so I exit out the game. I accidentally downloaded some sims 3 content and it ended up in my sims 4 folder and so I had to use the mod conflict detector to find out what was wrong with my game and why wasn't it launching, since then I started a new mods folder with everything that was in my old folder and I got a message saying the game won't start up which is weird because its the same cc I've been using for months. Most of my cc is updated or some don't need to be updated but It still shows up in the Mod Conflict Detector as a 'mod conflict' and now I'm really confused because I don't know what to do.

## What to do if conflicts arise while loading mods.

Conflicts that occur among the Sims script mods cannot be identified as easily as other issues by the user. An exception to this issue is the core mods. The core mods tend to have a higher chance of experiencing conflicts with one another. So, make sure you refrain from using two various core mods in one single go unless the creator of the mod has informed you that doing so is safe. Before you know how to use the mod conflict detector, make sure you understand the script mods in detail.
The two mods conflict with each other and the prior mod takes up the space. In an effort to keep both mods in tune, you might need to get in touch with the creators of the mod and get them to combine the two versions. Else, you will have to keep up with one mod at a single go.
After the mods folder comes the overrides folder and the packages folder (given that you have installed and configured the Resource.cfg file in a proper manner). This is followed by the DCC cache Folder and next comes the rest files in the installation directory for the game. So one way to detect the mod conflicts in a faster way is to use the ts4 mod conflict detector.
I use sims 4 mod manager and while it doesn't detect conflicts for you it does detect duplicates and you can "load"/"unload" mods to narrow down which one is screwing up your game. Way easier than doing it straight from your file manager. I have about 5000 mod files and there was one messing up my game. I found it no problem with the mod manager and in WAYYYY less time than if I did it via file explorer.
The loading priority for the mod in the game plays an important role in the way the game tackles the conflicts in the game resources. As a result, you can use the Sims 4, Sims 3, or Sims 2 mod conflict detector for finding the CC that has been creating a conflict in the game.
The best source of mod issues is the forums/site where you downloaded them. Don't use mods after any game patch until their author gives the okay or provides an update saying they are fine. Any mods where the authors aren't around anymore, I personally purge, although you can of course test and read community reports on how they are functioning. More hassle than it's worth imo though, as mods can often break things in game that are seemingly un-related to what the mod does. (I'm not saying do not use the analyzer...just don't expect it to save you much time managing mods).
Once you’ve installed and opened the program, it will prompt you to scan your files for available mods for The Sims 4. Scanned mods will appear as a list in the Scan Results tab, and the program will tell you about the mod types and if there are conflicts. Basically, from there, you can organize your TS4 mods and delete duplicates or unnecessary downloads using the Sims 3 mod conflict detector.
Script mods: You might face severe difficulties in finding problems in script mods as these mods have nearly zero chances of conflicts. You must know everything before you download any modification. You must know these very well and for that follow the steps below:
