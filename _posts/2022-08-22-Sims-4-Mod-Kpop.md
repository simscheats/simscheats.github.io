The create a sim system in The Sims 4 is the best one we’ve ever gotten, but it is still pretty limited. Thankfully, modders like Vibrant Pixels have created body sliders that can be used to drag body parts further than you are able to just with the game functions.
This is one of the must-have mods for the sims 4! This module (MCCC) by Deadperpool allows you to do almost everything in the game to your liking. From adding risky woohoo, changing the number of your babies to changing the weather, there’s nothing you can’t alter with this one.
This mod will allow you to go in your sim’s phone and choose a new hobby for them to participate in, which will cost 100 simoleons. They will then be off in a rabbit hole for a while and when they return they will have new interactions on the computer that relate to their new hobby.
Mods for the sims 4 include things like attending school with your children, having tragedies happen to your sims, and so much more. Below are 100+ mods that you can download for The Sims 4 that will change the game and are all really great options if you need to mix it up.

You should never have to pay for any sims 4 mods ever, this includes custom content too. There are actually rules that come directly from EA that state that you are not allowed to have things behind permanent pay walls and are only allowed to have these items on early access on things like Patreon but you must eventually make these items available for free.
The have some personality please mod, created by Polarbearsims (patreon)gives your sims a bit better personality, involving things like no idle chat, and more things learned from deep conversations. You can also use this mod for things like risky woohoo and giving your sim extra autonomy.
So so I changed a few strings so that my sims(and yours because I decided to share this) would listen to Kpop(or Jpop depending on which package you choose I didn’t take pictures because it’s the same just one letter changed oops) instead of Spop. Its a simple tiny mod and only conflicts with any other mod that changes that string as well. They do conflict with each other so only pick one. I also recommend that you add your own custom music because then why would you need this? I talk too much
This is one of my MUST HAVE, no matter what, always installed mods in The Sims 4. This mod allows you to click directly on the games UI to execute cheat commands. For example, if you click on a sim’s relationship with their spouse you can change their relationship values to increase or decrease their romance and friendship.

## Enjoy popular k-pop songs in the game!

In the club, you can also hit the dance floor together with your kpop group, and also you will have another draw card which is a k-pop table in the get-together expansion pack, and you can also make a small dance area in your house or penthouse to practice and then perform a dance with your group in the club as shown in the image below
K-Pop (or Korean pop or Korean popular music) is a musical genre and industry using a mix of electronic, hip hop, pop, rock, R&B, and other music. It began in South Korea. As well as music, K-pop has grown into a popular subculture among teenagers and young adults throughout Asia.
Kpop stars make music, and also they can write a song using a base game when they reach level eight of an instrument such as violin, guitar, piano, etc. When you reach level nine, you can license these songs using your mailbox, and your sim will feel like an artist.
When you are in the gallery, you need to search for Kpop groups in the search bar, and you will find a lot of groups that you can use as your base. You can also make all the tweaks and changes to the group sims until you are fully satisfied with your group.
For aspirations and traits, everyone’s personality is different so that you can choose according to your requirements. If you have a get-together expansion pack, you can also use the dance machine. Some kpop stars have western stage names like Wendy, Irene from red velvet.
You can provide your members multiple outfits of superstars, and also, these kpop stars don’t like to wear overly sexual outfits, so you need to make them look like stars. Kop groups are sometimes all girls or boys, but if you want a mixed group, you can also have them because you can also find some groups that have both girls and boys. You need to make sure that you have at least four group members upto eight, as shown in the image below.
The get famous expansion pack will give you a fame system in which you will get to a five-star celebrity superstar, and many kpop tasks will give you a lot of fame. You can also upload your dancing vlogs which will give you more fame, and if you have the streaming drone, which will give you the impression of doing live streams to your fans will also give you fame points, as shown in the image below.
If you have the city living expansion pack, you can access San Maisuno world, and your kpop stars can live anywhere in the house. Get together has two main k-pop draw cards, which are the premise of the pack being clubs which will bind your kpop group together. So you first need to create your club and then add your kpop members to it; only eight of the members can join your club. After that, you need a club leader because every kpop group has a leader and then name your leader.
