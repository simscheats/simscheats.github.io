We've put together a list of modders whose content adds extra utility to The Sims 4. Some of their mods are quality of life additions, others add new features or functionality and some even add an NSFW touch to your game. Check out this list of talented modders and see how their mods can enhance your Sims 4 gameplay.
Since sims 4 mods aren’t created by or maintained by EA there is always a chance that something in a mod can conflict with the way the game operates, especially since The Sims 4 is consistently updated. You want to find sims 4 mods that are consistently updated too because mods can break often, and can break your game if they aren’t updated.
With this mod, you can add bank lots to your game. Now, when a lot has the bank trait, your sims can fulfill their banking needs in person. Just edit any kind of lot and add the bank trait to it. But, it doesn’t have to be just that! It can also be a multiple-story building that has a floor that acts as the bank.
This is one of my MUST HAVE, no matter what, always installed mods in The Sims 4. This mod allows you to click directly on the games UI to execute cheat commands. For example, if you click on a sim’s relationship with their spouse you can change their relationship values to increase or decrease their romance and friendship.

These sims 4 mods have all been in my game at some point and have all brought me immense amounts of joy in the game. I absolutely love adding sims 4 mods because the game can get stale if you playa every single day for years and years. Hopefully you enjoyed this list of mods and it can inspire you to play something more exciting!
In The Sims 4 we are only given 3 slots for choosing traits for our sims which is a down grade from 5 in The Sims 3, which is disappointing. Thankfully, modders like Vicky Sims (patreon) create mods that you can use to add more traits which can help give your sims more personality.
This mod will allow you to go in your sim’s phone and choose a new hobby for them to participate in, which will cost 100 simoleons. They will then be off in a rabbit hole for a while and when they return they will have new interactions on the computer that relate to their new hobby.
These include activities like part-time jobs, gambling, and getting nails done. The best aspect of this mod is that the Sim can learn new skills and gain buffs. Players should note that while the mod works on the base game, it incorporates some aspects from some DLCs. Players without that specific additional content will be unable to reap the full benefits of relevant events.

## Use the mod bank to share your mods with other users.

What this mod intends to do ultimately, is create an extensive financial/banking system similar to what we humans have in real life. With our final feature added, we hope to add/boost your storylines in-game or even play out any financial situations that are limited only to your imagination.

With aspects such as rent, child support, alimony, paying bills, and availing government benefits, there is a lot to manage in this mod. It certainly adds a layer of depth that surprisingly feels missing unless experienced. Players only need the base game to use the mod.
But when this support page first went live, the part mentioning paid Early Access being allowed, wasn’t included. This led to a large backlash as many content creators and modders use the Early Access model to release mods to dedicated fans willing to pay before everything is working properly or finished. The idea is that once the mod is done, the devs release it for free and that paid period helps support them while working on finishing the mod.
If you're a builder then you've probably heard of Twisted Mexi, even if you've never used their mods. The main one is the T.O.O.L mod which stands for take objects off lot and does exactly this. There's also the better build buy mod that adds filters and names to debug items as well as enabling freecam in build mode.
Modder Scumbumbo is sadly no longer with us but a group of mod authors came together to produce a website in his memory. Here his mods from Mod The Sims are reposted with their original quirky headers and descriptions. They are kept updated, serving as a legacy of both his coding skills and wit.
Sometimes when I see a mod, I think wow, why is this not already a thing? There are a few interactions you’ll see pop up when a sim is in a certain emotional state but honestly there just aren’t enough. This mod adds a few new emotional socials for your sim to partake in that make a lot of sense.
