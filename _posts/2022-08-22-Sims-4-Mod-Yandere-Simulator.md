## Create a mod for the popular sims 4 game.

I saw this interesting challenge on the sims 3 challenges forum on MTS. It looked like so much fun I had to give it a try now that I have sims 4. So anyways, I guess the basic goal of the challenge is to have a single male sim father as many children as possible so here goes.

In the feature, we are looking at a very special project for the game Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord. The mod in question is called "Life in Calradia" by the author OneDrop. If you haven't played Bannerlord, it is a medieval-style action strategy game involving the huge world map of Calradia, several factions inspired by human history, hundreds of Nobles, and an assortment of beautifully created towns, castles, and villages.
- Give them only 1000 simoleons to start out with to cover the first week of bills.- Each sim can buy 1 item with what’s left of the money but it must be an item that is needed for their aspiration.- Each sim must do their part to make money to survive. What money is left over must be used to build their room of the house.- Each sim is responsible for building one room of the house.- The challenge ends when all of the sims become adults.
There are 3 small houses! Each is a 6x6 room. You may NOT add walls. You may NOT expand the houses. You have to live with this space! Ideally you’d only place objects on the grid Sims 1 or Sims 2 style, because that’s how objects are placed in Animal Crossing, but it’s really up to you. Decorate the houses as you please. The exterior can be decorated, but don’t cheat about it. Do not put kitchen objects outdoors, beds outdoors, etc. Only objects found in the Outdoors category can go outdoors, with the exception of a single toilet found outside for the sake of saving space.
The Animal Crossing VIllage can be found on the gallery by SimifyMeCaptain and you should probably have the Moveobjects Cheat enabled when installing it. (I had to remove the windows from the roofs of the houses because they just kept getting lost due to moveobjects being a bit buggy, sadly). This lot also uses the unlocked FISHING SPOT objects but Snatif on ModTheSims. I don’t know if they come with the lot or not, but I placed them by the pond. They’re not necessary, just a fun detail.

Aging is not required. You can turn it off, or leave it on. You can even play generations of sims if you want to. It does not matter. Your sim MAY get a job to pass the time, and unlock things, and to help with the bills, but once they reach level 10 they must quit. All sims on the lot can have a job, but their combined job level cannot be over 12. So if you have two sims, and one is at level 8, and one is at level 3, one of them has to quit before the other is allowed to get promoted. If one is promoted, the other is required to quit immediately. This is just so you can’t roll in dough and are encouraged to spend time ignoring the job-money grind of typical Sims gameplay. :D Please note that because of the lot being owned by your sim, the bills will be pretty high to start. You might have trouble keeping up with them. That’s okay. If you’ve played Animal Crossing, you know why!
You don't necessarily need every one of the packs I used, you can replace furniture with anything from the packs you do own. The layout of the house won't change, just things like the furniture and wallpaper/flooring, and maybe some of the landscaping.There is also a base game only version that you can download instead.
Recently there's been some silly drama on our site that was sparked by someone uploading a mod for Spider-Man Remastered. The mod replaced the very few Pride flags the game actually has with the already prevalent USA flag texture from the game. The mod was removed from Nexus Mods and the author was banned.
Did you know that our site started out as a fansite for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind? That's right, and that was back in 2001 when the site launched under the name "Morrowind Chronicles" in anticipation of and leading up to the game's release exactly 20 years ag...

## Create a sim that is based on yandere simulator.

Yandere Simulator is a stealthaction video game currently in development by American game developer YandereDev. The game centers upon an obsessively lovesick schoolgirl named Ayano Aishi, nicknamed "Yandere-chan", who has taken it upon herself to eliminate anyone she believes is monopolizing her senpai's attention.
This is a subreddit where fans of Yandere Simulator can gather to discuss the game in peace, without having to see any posts about drama. If you would like to join our community, visit discord.gg/yandere and read the #read-me channel for instructions!

There other ways to get rid of Osana and the other rivals. Like getting them expelled or making Senpai to reject your rival and for the sexual content is not too bad..I mean watch anime and when girls panties are showing idrc, and when you take a bath at school your GONNA have to take off your clothes. But, Hey! at least Yandere Dev is covering what needs to be covered. Look at the bright side at least its not HENTAI!

Random Daily Events:- Assign a number to each sim.- At the beginning of each sim day, generate one random number. This number specifies the sim who will get the random daily event.- Generate another random number to determine if the event will be lucky or unlucky.- Generate another random number to determine that day’s random event for the sim.
In Yandere Simulator, the title of "Senpai" is given to the young man (or young woman) that the protagonist is infatuated with. The player is given the option of choosing Senpai's gender at the beginning of the game; they might be "Senpai-kun", or they might be "Senpai-chan". If Senpai is a male, his name is Taro Yamada, and if she is a female, her name is Taeko Yamada.
Once again, I've been watching videos from youtubers playing Yandere sim and I also watch Yandere Dev for A LONG TIME. I've gotten used to the killing and the taking picture of the panties. I think people for 15 or up is mature enough to play this game. Let's all be honest here, WE ALL seen worse. Am I right?
