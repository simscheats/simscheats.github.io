And if you’re a total beginner in Sims 4 and you don’t know how to download and install mods, I’ll include a quick guide down below. But make sure to check my general Mods and CC guide for a detailed look into adding mods and custom content to the game.
Welcome! This post is a complete collection of the best mods for Sims 4 in 2022. Here you’ll find extensions that can improve your gameplay and introduce new ways and game options to play TS4. So scroll down and pick your favorite mod for this year! Because although Electronic Arts (EA) did a great job with The Sims 4, modders and creators have managed to enrich the game tremendously!
This step might be intimidating if you’ve never installed sims 4 mods before. One of the biggest reasons we hesitated from installing mods was because it seemed complicated. However, it’s straightforward and no harder than simply locating the correct folder.
Since sims 4 mods aren’t created by or maintained by EA there is always a chance that something in a mod can conflict with the way the game operates, especially since The Sims 4 is consistently updated. You want to find sims 4 mods that are consistently updated too because mods can break often, and can break your game if they aren’t updated.

You should never have to pay for any sims 4 mods ever, this includes custom content too. There are actually rules that come directly from EA that state that you are not allowed to have things behind permanent pay walls and are only allowed to have these items on early access on things like Patreon but you must eventually make these items available for free.
From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.
If you've ever thought that the parenting options in The Sims 4 are a little bit thin on the ground, this is most definitely a mod that you need to download. From a creator named Caradriel, Better Babies and Toddlers does exactly what it says on the tin – it makes major improvements in the baby and toddler department.
For those of you who are tired of being bombarded with phone calls from sims you’ve never met, or don’t want to bother sharing your personal information with the world, here’s the mod for you. The Sims 4 is already a pretty realistic game, but with this mod, it will become even more realistic. Now your phone number will be private and only given out to people you want. It’s just like in real life! Download from this page.

To help you navigate what's on offer, here’s a lineup of the best Sims 4 mods, from the little tweaks, to the digital life-changers. Make sure to read the installation section, and double check for any conflicts to make sure you’re not running two that will butt heads.
These sims 4 mods have all been in my game at some point and have all brought me immense amounts of joy in the game. I absolutely love adding sims 4 mods because the game can get stale if you playa every single day for years and years. Hopefully you enjoyed this list of mods and it can inspire you to play something more exciting!
And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?
You just need to look at the game’s strong library of user generated content to see what’s really keeping the lights on. The Sims 4 mods scene is thriving, with plenty of weird and wonderful additions to the base game. We’ve compiled a list of what we think are the best Sims 4 mods accompanied with links to all the download pages. Be sure to read the install instructions for each mod.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
Each new pack release in the game sees the army of modders on Tumblr, Patreon, and sites like ModTheSims jumping in to improve features or expand upon them. After trawling the internet, we’ve put together a list of our personal best mods for The Sims 4.
With so many impressive Sims 4 mods out there, choosing the best ones is no easy task. Some of them fix common gameplay issues, while others add more depth to your Sims' stories. Whether you're looking for more cheats or just want to turn your Sims' world into a horror movie, there's something for everyone!
