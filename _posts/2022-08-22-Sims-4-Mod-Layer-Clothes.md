As said to one of the above simmers, I by no means assume anything involved in the creation or editing of this feature is easy, and yes, I agree its not really worth the amount of time, energy and resources to just add layering, but, that is why I cared to mention a sims 4 twist which would hopefully make the feature worth having, in short terms, have it part of a bigger fashion related update which would take a good deal of time and such, but the team wouldn't be scratching their heads or pulling out their hair trying to understand why they were going to so much effort for a single thought which could easily come back and kick them in their plums.
And as much as I loath the thought of silly outfit mash ups should this option be made real, I also enjoy it, yes it would mean a possibly game breaking mash up of layers and awful choices clothes wise but people in the real world do that, you have challenges of 20 or more shirts or trousers or underwear, why should sims lack the ability to be as stupid and ridiculous as we are? Also don’t forget those sim tube views.
To import the Sims texture template or UV map, click File and click Open as Layers (GIMP) or Place (Photoshop) and click the checkmark icon at the top of the screen. Drag the layer with the template or UV map below the clothing texture in the Layers panel to the left.
3.3 Adding Texture On UVs ShapesOpen the file we just created in 2D editor(we use photoshop if you use other software you should know how to do what i show here).once you open it in photoshop add a new white layer on the back of our main layer, you should see something like part A of image 7, you can see the UVs shaped like body, i want to drew my basic shirt shape on them in the position i want to have my shirt on.in part B of image 7 you can see i drew my red shirt, and for the bottom part i drew very dark red fading to black,now i make only my red shirt layer visible, so the white background and UVs not shown any more, and save it as LemonShirt_Texture.png, and save a back .psd to.i go back into sims 4 studio, remember in begging of tutorial on image 2 we exported our mesh, so now we want to click on the blue button for import mesh , and import our .blend file.and now we will click on the "swatch and texture" tab from the left of the mesh tab, and under texture press the import button, then choose our LemonShirt_Texture.png and import it.in parts C and D of image 7 you can see how it look, look like the model was sprayed with red color. and on the bottom its blackish like we wanted.Image 7

6.Reflections And Shadows.6.1 Specular Maps.Specular maps are 2D maps who provide information on how shinny and area is, this can also cause an effect that gives illusion of reflections, the shine value is taken from brightness of the color we use in our map, more bright give more shine value(it doesn't matters if you use RGB or Gray-scale the value only taken from amount of brightness). When creating a clothing item for sims 4 you mostly want to use Specular map to give amount of shine to your material other then create a shine map. if you know mapping you can use this map to create custom shine shapes to give it more realistic look, But for the once who don't know mapping just give simple shine info will do just fine, cause the specular map react with bump map give it pretty real looks. Lets create our specular map, First we want to open our texture .PNG in photoshop, and we will click Ctrl+Shift+S to save as, and save it as new file name, mine is LemonShirt_SpecMap.Click Alt+Ctrl+I and it will open the "image size" box as shown in part A of image 13, change the Width to 512, it will automaticly change the height to 1024, if it didn't to it your self.On the bottom of layer panel click the little fx icon and choose color overlay as shown in part B of image 13, in the dialog box click on the color, and it will open a color map for you, choose the color you wish, remember the more bright color you choose the more shine your material will get, click for the color, and then click ok for the dialog box, and now your material got its shine, if you create clothing that made from more then 1 material you should make a color for each part, for example if i had a leather belt around the bottom of my shirt, i would create map look like the map in part D of image 13, so you can see the belt get brighter color then the shirt, cause leather is more shinny, and if my belt have metal buttons on it i would make does even brighter then the leather. so after you done give a color to each one of your materials we can save the file as .PNG. The specular map uses an other file as an alpha channel, we need to create that file, this is very simple, open the .png specular map you just saved, click Ctrl+U and drag the slider under brightness all the way up, click ok, then create a new layer, put the new layer under our layer so it used as background, and fill it with black, now you need to save that file with the same name you gave your specular map file, only add .mask at the end of the name, if your specular map file name is "MyMap.png" , your alpha channel file will be called "MyMap.mask.png".
I agree with you on the fact they would need to go through all the clothes they’ve ever created to enable a fashionable and realistic pairing of “everything”, however, I’m not foolish enough to assume they wouldn’t put a sims 4 twist on this feature to make it their own, or something new so nobody is annoyed by this possible option,
Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
I extruded the bottom part of the shirt as you can see in "part A"of Image 4, then i choose all the vertexes on the outer line of the bottom shirt, and i moved the down a little.in sims 4 we usually see our models from Front-Top view, but we still want to make our item to look good from any angle. and after we pull down the outer bottom line u can see it look better in "part C" of image 4.in "part D" i pull some vertexes out to give some volume to my shirt.and that about it for my mesh, in this example i showed how to make very basic changes, to make it easy for beginners, if you know modelling feel free to go crazy.

## Create clothing for your sims 4 characters using the create-a-sim tool.

Are you not satisfied with the clothing selection in the Sims 4? Do you want to add your own clothes? It's easier than you think to make your own clothing mods. You need a copy of The Sims 4, The Sims 4 Studio, and an image editor such as Photoshop or GIMP. This wikiHow teaches you how to make your own clothing mods for The Sims 4.
Download Sim body texture templates (optional). These weird looking image textures are used to map out where your clothing textures are placed on your Sims. There are four different image templates and UV maps. One for female Sims, male Sims, toddlers, and child Sims. While we won't be using these for this tutorial, you may decide you want to use them for more advanced options as you get better as creating clothing for your Sims. You can download these images on The Sims 4 Studio forum.
Select the edited texture image and click Open. Locate the image file you edited and exported from Photoshop or GIMP and click it to select it. Then click Open to import the image. The model in Sims 4 Studio should now be wearing the clothing you designed.
And the last step is to type the actual Sims 4 copy outfit cheat line, which is outfits.copy_outfit. Now, because there are several outfit categories (e.i. Format, Swimwear, Everyday, Athletic), you’ll need to insert a number at the end of the cheat line.
Select a clothing item you want to edit and click Next. You can select any clothing item in the game. Use the drop-down menus at the top of Sims 4 Studio to filter your selection choices. Click the item you want to edit and click Next in the lower-right corner.
Are you looking for the best Clothes CC, Mods & Packs for The Sims 4? Or would you rather browse through our catalog for the best clothes for your Sims? Either way, you have come to the right place! Pore over a list of 50 Sims 4 clothes mods and CC. Enjoy!
Clothes are probably the most essential part of playing The Sims 4. This is because they give your Sims the opportunity to reflect their respective personalities. There is an endless amount of clothing items for the Sims 4 game including tops, bottoms, and outfits which you can choose from to custom create outfits for your Sims. We hope this list was both useful and fun to read! See you later!
Changing outfits isn’t always the most fun idea. Sure, having all kinds of different outfits for all the different situations is cool. But it’s also a lot of work! So having to choose an appropriate outfit for every possible occasion isn’t the dream of many simmers. And sometimes, they just want to use one outfit for multiple different occasions. So how do you copy outfits in The Sims 4 and reuse them in other outfit slots?
