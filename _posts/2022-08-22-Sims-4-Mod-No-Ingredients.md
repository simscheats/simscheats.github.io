## Sims 4 mod no ingredients

Nope? Ok.The no ingredients mod is actually a really great mod because the Sim will be able to cook & grill everything and will use what he has as an optional choice. I love the mod because of no need to have all these bugs in inventory or fish in fridge for special recipes.

Mod Description
No Required Ingredients is similar to No More Ingredients Needed Mod by cyberops (later updated by catalina_45). However, instead of completely removing the ingredients options for all recipes, I only set those that required them to be optional. Therefore, it didn’t require so many resources. So, with my version you can optionally use ingredients if you have them:
Lastly, if none of these step’s help, you may want to look online for users with a similar issue. Head to Sims 4 or EA Games forums and search for threads dedicated to that specific trait and the term “mod not working.” Perhaps, the issue is well-known, and The Sims 4 community has already found a solution.
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
For all Sims 4 Cheats on Sim Needs “testingcheats true” (PC/MAC) or “testingcheats on” (console) must be enabled. If you click on your Sim with Shift + Left Mouse Button, you will also get the options to make your Sim happy or to enable/disable the Need Dacay.

Sims 4 files are stored in two folders, one located in Program Files and the second one in Documents/Electronic Arts/TheSims4. Check the second location. If the folder is not there, chances are you’ve accidentally deleted it, or the game failed to create it. Not to worry – that’s fixable.
@alexisbiancax it's probably not a bug, you're most likely playing on one of the new lots that has the new "Simple Living" Lot Challenge activated.It's a new lot challenge (something they've extended from Lot Traits) that comes with Cottage Living. It means that you cannot cook anything unless you actually have the ingredients on your sim's inventory or in the fridge.If you want to turn that off, just go into build mode, go to the lot traits and challenges panel and remove it.
NoRequiredIngredientsFOOD – You can still use this even if there are recipes listed from a pack you don’t own. Those recipes simply won’t show up. For example, if you don’t have GTW (which includes the Baking Recipes), you can still use the mod for base game recipes.
To be specific, the MTS page for the mod indicates that there used to be a 'Required Ingredients' to go along with 'No Required Ingredients' but Scarlet decided to stop maintaining it because she doesn't use it, and it was already broken when she made that decision. Haven't seen any others like it myself.

## Sims 4 players can now create mods without having to find and collect ingredients.

And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?
You can find many mods over at ModTheSims, which hosts a wealth of community-made free mods for you to download and enjoy as you please. Installing mods is simple enough – all you need to do is drag the mod files over to the game’s mod folder. In a typical setup, this should be Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
To help you navigate what's on offer, here’s a lineup of the best Sims 4 mods, from the little tweaks, to the digital life-changers. Make sure to read the installation section, and double check for any conflicts to make sure you’re not running two that will butt heads.
Do you ever feel like your Sims are a bit bland? This mod will add a little spice to your game as well as your Sims’ lives. No more idle chatting where your Sims don’t learn anything about each other. Now they will make use of their interactions with each other, chatting, getting to know them, etc.
If your Sim needs to be social but you’re not really feeling the whole conversation aspect of The Sims 4, you can download this mod to increase the social mood faster. Gone are the days when you’d have to actually pretend to care how that Sim friend’s day went.
You just need to look at the game’s strong library of user generated content to see what’s really keeping the lights on. The Sims 4 mods scene is thriving, with plenty of weird and wonderful additions to the base game. We’ve compiled a list of what we think are the best Sims 4 mods accompanied with links to all the download pages. Be sure to read the install instructions for each mod.
