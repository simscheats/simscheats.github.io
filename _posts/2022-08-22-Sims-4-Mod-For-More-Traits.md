## Modify the traits in the sims 4 with a sims 4 mod.

This is obviously not a satisfactory way to play the game. But the best solution for this problem is to install a bunch of Sims 4 traits mods. In my personal experience, I’ve tried over 100 trait mods. And honestly, some have really changed how I play the game.

Thankfully, modders can fix just about everything in the game at this point and a mod called More Traits in CASexists to save us all from these woes. With this mod you’ll be able to add more traits to your sims no matter the life stage. There really isn’t anything better for solving the sims 4 more traits problem!
However, we highly advise you to try as many of the showcased mods as possible. Traits will not change the way you play the game essentially, but they will introduce new perspectives. At the least, they will refreshen your playtime and make you want to play The Sims 4 even more!
It is important to note with these mods that there is some conflicts in The Sims 4 with certain traits when you add too many. You may not see a lot of interactions from one trait when you have 5 and the game may focus on a couple instead of all of them.
As mentioned above, the Sims 4 trait mods are deeply personal. And although I showcased many quality trait mods in this post, the choice of which one you should download is ultimately yours. Everybody is different and everyone plays the game in a unique way. So, download the trait mods that you want to select for your own Sims!

And another neat addition is this pack of traits for your kids. There is something about the kids’ traits in The Sims 4 that we particularly enjoy. And thanks to this mod, we can use more of them. On top of that, you’ll get new and original traits in Sims 4 too!
Once the players find the Traits they want, they just need to download them onto their computer. These Traits should exist as .package files, and if not, the file's folder may need to be unzipped. Once players have all their ".package" files ready, they need to open their Electronic Arts folder and then the Sims 4 folder within it. This can be accessed easily through Origin by right-clicking on The Sims 4 game and selecting the option to take the player straight to the game files.
Your sims personalities are very important to how they behave and the things they are good at and enjoying doing and without sims 4 more traits mods you can’t do much. We only get the option of having three traits for adults and some of those might get wasted on things like dietary choices like Lactose Intolerant or Vegetarian so it’s hard to really give your sims a personality.
