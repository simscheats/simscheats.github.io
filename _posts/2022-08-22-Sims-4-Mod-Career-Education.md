## Create a sims 4 career in the modding community.

I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre not the only one wishing for more career options for your Sims. Sure, there are a lot of careers included in the base game, but this mod has more options that have been missed by the developers. With four new career paths for firefighters, hotel employees, stylists, and private tutors to the game, the mod package makes a great addition for fans of a larger variety of career paths. These mods, published by sims-blog.de, have more than 300,000 downloads to date at ModTheSims, making them one of the most popular mods in the community. To download the modifications, just go to this page.

The Sims 4 has given a new dimension to its gameplay. The introduction of the career mod has not only enabled players to pursue their desired careers and live their dreams but also make the gameplay more realistic. Inspired by real-life comedians, the comedian career mod allows players to make their sims the next big thing in comedy. Whether they want to be a professional comedian, famous social media influencer, or amateur street performer, it is up to them. It is often assumed that being a comedian is one of the hardest jobs out there because they need confidence, wit, and comedy skills on top of being talented at making people laugh. Jokes will be told at random when your sim is using the microphone in any venue. Feel free to download this one from this page.
The Film Career Mod developed by Arriannar allows you to have a reputable film career in The Sims 4. With this career mod, you can either be a film actor or a film director, depending on which track you‚Äôd choose. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that careers added with this mod are based on the film career path from The Sims 3, including job tracks for both teenagers and adults. To use it in the game, just the base game is required. You may download the file and find further information at:
And one last thing, (I know this intro is getting longüòÖ) if you want to make the base game sims 4 active careers more fun, I highly recommend downloading the Get to Work Aspirations Mod which you can find linked in my 36+ Sims 4 Custom Aspirations post (it‚Äôs #32 on the list!)
A new mod has been created for the game The Sims 4 that will allow your sim to have their own Youtube channel. Your sim can upload videos of themselves playing games, DIY or makeup tutorials, and more. They can also update their channel with blog posts, vlogs, and live streams to keep up their gamer, DIY, or MUA cred on top of having a full-time job. Another cool thing about this mod is that it will let your sim go vlogging and make videos of their everyday life. To take your Sim down this career path, know that they will struggle. So, you need to have some patience. Check it out on this page.

The Sims 4 offer a lot of opportunities for careers, professions, and ambitions. There are many mods that allow The Sims 4 players to experience new careers or professions in the game, but some of them are better than others. In this article, I give a list of some of the best CC packs for Sims 4 job and career mods. Enjoy!
This mod allows your sim to have more than one job at a time. This means that they can do all their favorite things and get paid for it It also brings with it new careers, part-time jobs, and freelance trades for you to add to your gameplay. If you are looking for some ways to spice up your gameplay and make it more realistic then this might be what you were looking for! With this mod, your sim can join as many different careers as they want at once and do them all simultaneously. However, they will still need to manage their time wisely so that they can balance their work-life with their personal life. Head over to this page for easy download.
Sims 4 Studio: This program does a wide variety of things, but one of its functions is to manage and maintain custom content. You can use this program to merge/unmerge your package files and run batch fixes on incorrectly categorized CC.

The Sims 4 is a life-simulation game that mainly focuses on letting players control the life of their virtual characters. The game encourages players to explore the virtual world and take responsibility for their in-game avatars. The social services mod simulates the social services profession, which is designed to promote the welfare, safety, and well-being of every Sim in the game. It ensures that Sim citizens are healthy and happy by providing public healthcare services, education, and social care to those in need. To install this one, follow this page.

## Learn about the modding community and how to join it.

Read the entire description of the mod or CC you want to download carefully. The creator will highlight any important info you need to know. How it works, what it does, how to use it, how to download it, where to find it in the game, whether it requires a mesh or a certain pack, whether it conflicts with another mod, etc. Everything you need to know will be in the description, so never skim over it.
@DMDragonCT Thanks so much! If you did have anything to add I would definitely pay attention because I always learn things from your posts. :DBtw- days like today are why I keep so many notes on the mods I use. I wasn't expecting many changes/updates for a patch like today's but surprisingly there are updates required for two of them! I'm still waiting for a status update on one more, but no worries, I always keep a mod/CC-free save for bug testing and for something to play while I wait for status updates. ;-D
Hey simmers,please could I have some help? I am new to downloading mods, I've seen youtube videos and heard people say how fun they are and I love the hairstyles and stuff you can download.However... I have no idea what websites are safe to download from and how to tell the creator isn't sketchy and hasn't put virus on the mod?¬†Please help me and advise me!
If you downloaded a lot from the gallery, make sure it‚Äôs one made for this mod. You can find lots by selecting¬†‚ÄúElementary School‚Äù or¬†‚ÄúHigh School‚Äù as the lot type in the gallery filter, and checking¬†‚ÄúInclude Custom Content‚Äù.¬†Most¬†lots in that section should work correctly, but since I don‚Äôt control the gallery, I can‚Äôt stop people from uploading lots that don‚Äôt work.
The number one thing you need to know about mods is that they break. They break a LOT. After almost every single game update, in fact. This means that you‚Äôll be redownloading your mods constantly. If this sounds like too much hassle for you, then mods are probably not for you. If you are willing to keep your Mods folder maintained on a regular basis, then continue reading!
Better Exceptions by TwistedMexi: This is a mod that makes in-game errors easier to understand for people who aren‚Äôt computer-savvy. It will tell you exactly what caused the error in plain English so you can better pinpoint which mod or piece of CC you need to update or remove.
If the creator has announced that their mod is still compatible with the latest update, great! It‚Äôs good, you don‚Äôt need to update it. If the creator has released a new version of their mod, download the newest version and replace the old version in your Mods folder.
If it weren't for the fact that cheats are meant to be somewhat secret and naughty (they do stop you from earning achievements, for example), we'd recommend this mod to everyone. If you're already using cheats on PC or Mac, you really should get it and save yourself some effort as you bend the game to your will.
