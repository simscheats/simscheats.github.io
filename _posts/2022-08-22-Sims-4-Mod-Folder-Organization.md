## Simplify sims 4 mod installation and management.

If you ask why, then you’re on the right track to make your life a lot easier. You see, the Mod Manager is a quality of life, fully developed software that helps you organize all The Sims 4 files. If you’ve ever found yourself in the mess of all the additional mods and CC you download for the game, then this is your ticket out of that hell!

After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
After you install the program, the main framework that you’ll be using in it is called Manage Mods. If you click on it, an empty page will open up. Since you have just now installed it for the first time, you will need to import all of your mods and CC. That’s easily done through the little plus “+” button at the bottom left corner. But be aware that sometimes the program links to your Sims 4 folder, and if you already have mods and CC loaded to the game, they might appear on the page.
So I’ve had a few requests here and there regarding mods and custom content for The Sims 4 on Mac, now that it has finally been released. If you know about my mods guide for The Sims 3, you would know that it was written for the sole purpose of making it easier to understand for those who aren’t familiar with using mods or custom content (CC) in their games. Hopefully, this one will do the exact same thing for you all.
Hi @dunstz - I moved your post to The Sims 4 General Discussion for more help. I'm sure there are some very helpful people here who can help you with your particular questions.While you're here, you may want to review This Thread on bug reporting when using Mods/CC. Carl's tutorial on How to Install and Download Mods & CC for TS4 might be helpful for you, too. Happy Simming!

The Sims 4 client will only go one-level deep when looking for script mods. In the screenshot above, you’ll see that the “McCmdCenter” file is in the very first level of the Mods folder. If you don’t do this correctly, script mods will not appear in your game.
btw, do you know of any mods tracker for ts4 mac? if not, do you have any advices or useful tips? i installed a whole bunch of mods at once and my game keeps crashing now x/ when i manage to get it loading my sims does not interact with each other when i click for them to interact like ask about day or share interest.
Okay, thank you. I dragged the .packages into the mods sub folder and when I opened the sims 4 game it read “Mods: Maxis does not pre-screen or support mods. Please use with caution”. The two mods I dragged were under the “custom content” instead of being under “script mods”. When I went into create a sim mode neither of my mods were there. What am I supposed to do now?
If anyone can help me…I just downloaded sims 4.i have downloaded a couple pieces of mods.i have a macbook air.and the mod is already unzipped.when I try to go in my mods folder it wont let me place anything in it and the resource.cfg file is all greyed out…what do I do???

## Organize your sims 4 mods within folders.

Now you are able to go five sub-folders deep in your mods folder. I suggest that you keep all your mods on the top level and only use the sub-folders for your custom content. Many mods (especially those that are zipped) need to be on the top level. How you organize at this point is really up to you but I will show you how mine looks to give you an idea. I like to organize my folder by what it is and then the creator. So for example my path to a shoes by Madlen would look like this: C:\Users\****\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods\Custom Content\Clothing\Madlen
I wanted to talk to you about organizing your Sims 4 folders. I’m one of those people who likes everything nice and tidy, including my Sims 4 folders. So, I wanted to show you how I organize my folder. This will be done in multiple articles with the first one covering the mods folder.
@dunstz Here is another great article about organizing and maintaining mods and CC:https://simscommunity.info/2018/08/08/the-sims-4-how-to-ensure-a-healthy-game/2/@Psychotps I think the default number of sub-folders for .package files is 5 levels deep unless you edit your Resource.cfg file.EDIT: @Psychotps I meant to add awesome post on Mods folder organization and maintenance!
I'm fairly new to Sims. And I recently found out about Mods and CC, but I have a decent understanding. I wanted to know more about organizing my folders within the "Mods" folder. I heard that you can only have one folder deep, but within which folder. So to better understand, let's say I wanted to download clothes, hair, etc. My folders would have to look like this: The Sims 4 Mods Clothes Creator (creator's name) or Type of Clothes. Am I far off, or close to right?I've been looking for someone who could explain in detail at a slow pace for me to understand, and sadly I'm still a little confused. I really want to learn and enjoy my game, and I don't want to mess anything up. Can someone suggest an easy way to organize and install these so they're easier to find later.
Before beginning the tidying up process, copy and paste your entire Sims 4 folder somewhere safe. My suggestion is a thumb drive dedicated strictly for Sims. Get the largest you can afford. A quick search of Amazon shows that a 128gig flash drive can be purchased for under $35 USD. Try to get an even bigger one, if you can. You should already be doing this on a regular basis of your important folders. These include your saves, tray, screenshots, and mods folders. Backing up ensures that you will not have a catastrophic loss of your important Sim documents later.
In The Sims 4, there are two custom content folders: Tray for lots and Sims, and Mods for other content. Both of these folders are located in:
Windows XP:Documents and Settings\(Your User Account)\My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\
Windows Vista, Windows 7/8, Mac:Users\(Your User Account)\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.
And if you click on the furthermost tool in the same corner, the one labeled Open The Sims 4 “Mods” folder, you will be directed to the destination of your installed mod. Notice that if a mod isn’t checked/selected in the main list on the Mod Manger, then it won’t be shown in the folder either.
