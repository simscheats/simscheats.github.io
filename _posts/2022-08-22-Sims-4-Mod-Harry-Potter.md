You’ve probably wondered what would it look like to play with characters from Harry Potter in The Sims 4. There are plenty of talented creators and modders out there who made it all possible. Down below you’ll see creations and mods that’ll help you bring Howarts to life!
Last but not least is Grimmauld Place, created by modder Ineliz. This building is fully functional and you can come inside with your Sims and explore around. Some items are made by the modder themselves and are fully functional to interact with. According to the modder, this building is not a carbon copy of the one from the Harry Potter series, but we will take it. Install this mod, and immerse yourself with your Sims into the magical world of Harry Potter.
Fairy mods, real-life mods, sci-fi mods, and more, are only a drop in the sea of the different content available for the Sims 4. Harry Potter franchise is one of them, and wizard world fever caught on the Sims 4, and modders spent a lot of time making Harry Potter-themed CCs and mods. In this article, we will present you with the list of the 20 best Harry Potter CCs and mods in Sims 4.
The modder LadySeiko decided to create custom rugs for Sims 4. These custom-made Harry Potter rugs for your Sims are really cool if you did not go overboard in the Harry Potter design of the house.

Your Sim child can now stroll around with you through the mall or city, and show off with great Harry Potter hoodies that come in six colors. The base game is just enough for this mod, so do not worry if you need to spend another $50 on the Sims 4 expansion.
We all have watched or read Harry potter at some point of our lives and some of us are more than a fan of Harry Potter franchise. Keeping that in mind, here are Harry Potter themed mod that will let you style your Sim form clothes to home décor, and you will find it very satisfying to see your Sim living a Harry Potter dream in the Sims world.
Do you want to go full immersion style and be Draco Malfoy from Harry Potter? Check out this Death Eater tattoo Livvy1811 created for Harry Potter fans. Really reflective of the real deal in the books and movies, this tattoo will make your Sims be a Death Eater. If you want to be on the side of evil, definitely check out this mod.
We continue this list with clothes mods. Quidditch is a big deal in the Harry Potter universe, and if you want to root for your team you need to have cool merchandise as well. Modder allouise decided to replicate quidditch sweaters that are worn by the players in the movies, in The Sims 4 universe. Available in 4 swatches, and in club colors your Sims support, this is a great CC with the rest Harry Potter-themed clothes we already mentioned on this list.

## Create a sims 4 mod for any game.

You can download these creations by clicking the creation names linked below. Mods and Custom Content can be simply installed by extracting and / or pasting .package files to Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods folder. Make sure you have Mods / CC enabled in your game options!
As the name of this mod suggests, it aims to bring The Sims 4 closer to reality. It does this by adding a range of emotions, the ability to get drunk, the chance to get acne, the menstrual cycle, colds and flu, and memories. And that's not everything! You'll wonder how you played the game without this mod.
As is always the case, however, The Sims 4 Wicked Whims requires you to download and install the mod before you’ll be able to get up to all your freaky Sims sex-related business. Down below, we’ll talk you through the stages of downloading, installing, and using Sims 4’s Wicked Whims mod.
Once you’ve located this file path, simply move the WickedWhimsMod folder that you extracted from the archive folder and paste it into the The Sims 4 Mods folder. Do not delete or move the ‘Resource.cfg’ file that should be in the mods folder, as this is required to allow mods to work.
MC Command Center does so much, we'd be here all day describing it. Essentially, it lets you control every aspect of your Sims---and even grants minor control to usually non-playable characters. For many, this mod includes what the base game should have. You can ban clothes, control pregnancies, remove homeless ghosts, and more.
This mod redesigns the mood and emotions system of The Sims 4. In the base game, your Sims will be joyful because of a nice lamp one minute, then angry from a faulty shower the next. This mod makes your Sims' lives more meaningful (and challenging), with emotions that reflect real life---a first kiss creates true happiness, while a depressive rut can last for days.
This mod isn't as radical as some of the others listed here, but it fixes an incredibly annoying behavior that Sims in the game possess. Now you can set which sinks your Sims can or can't wash up in. No longer will they pick up their finished dish from the table and then head to the bathroom to wash it in that sink. Rejoice!
