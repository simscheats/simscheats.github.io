## The sims 4 mod root folder is where all the mods for the game live.

place these files in documents / electronic arts / the sims 4 / mods. or you can place them in a subfolder named after the mod, this is often how they're setup by the creator after the mod is extracted. mods can go one subfolder deep in the root Mods folder, while cc can go up to five.

When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.
Custom content and general mods: These files end in .package. Open the Mod folder the game has created (Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods) and copy all the mod files into the folder. You can create additional subfolders to organize your growing mod collection better.
I have been playing sims 4 for some time now and i wish to add mods to it, however i find that every mod instructs people to put there files in the mod folder. However i cannot find such folder as it seems that i my game has installed in the origin's game folder and not in the Electronic arts folder (which is were everyone else's game seems to be) and thus the folders are completely different and in some cases missing like the mod folder.How do i install the sims 4 in the electronic arts folder? hope by doing so will fix my problem but i have tried to re-install the game several times and searched for an option to change it but i cant seem to find one...
Step 1 - create the new location: copy your Mods directory (or whichever directory you wish) to your desired location. Just remember the file path to your new Mods location. When I was done copying, I had the following file path structure: "E:\Sims 4 Mods\Mods"

After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:
Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
The Sims 4 client will only go one-level deep when looking for script mods. In the screenshot above, you’ll see that the “McCmdCenter” file is in the very first level of the Mods folder. If you don’t do this correctly, script mods will not appear in your game.
