## The sims 4 mod folder has been deleted, meaning all mods created for the game are now invalid.

@LottieGrayYT That's not the Sims 4 folder where you need to add mods. As the original instructions say, the correct folder is in Documents\Electronic Arts. Be sure to start your game at least once, so that this Sims 4 folder will be created.And please remove the Mods folder you created from the Sims 4 folder in Program files (x86). That data doesn't belong there and can only cause problems.

@ThisIsMePlayingI'm sure the game has created a new mods folder in your game. Maybe you're looking in the wrong place. . The game is installed in two folders, One folder is in Program files and this should not be touched. Second folder is in Dokuments / Electronic Arts / The Sims4 and there must be a new mods folder in the game folder.I don't work for EA
Hence you should navigate to the mod’s website and make sure that the mod which you downloaded is indeed that of Sims 4 and not of the earlier versions. You can easily check this by seeing the changelog or the category in which they are placed. Identify the incompatible mods and remove them.
Hi @tabiisemoji8, please explain your problem a bit more! Did you delete your folder or does your mods not show up in the game?If the mods are not showing up: Did your cc work before today? Have you made any changes since the last time playing?- Make sure cc/mods is enabled in game (check the boxes in the game options)If you deleted your folder: Make sure there is no "Mods"-folder in C:\Users\Username\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4Restart the gameExit the gameCheck C:\Users\Meki\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4 again, a new folder, called Mods, should be created. Put your mods there.If this doesn't work, do you have onedrive on your computer? ____________________________________________________________________If you find an answer helpful, give your fellow simmers some XP! Also remember to click "Accept as solution" if a post answered your question.Happy simming! :eahigh_file:
@chloherm714Did your folder get deleted or does your mods not show up in game? The file directory is your folder, what exactly are you asking for?Usually you have the mods in C:\Users\Username\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\mods, if you deleted them, check your trash can.If you have the mods in the folder but they're not showing up in game:I guess you double checked that script mods and cc were activated in the game options? Both of them?And then you have mods that do not work? All mods or just some? If it's just some mods that do not work, which ones?If no mods show up in your gameDid you place them in C:\Users\Username\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\ModsDo the game register that there are mods? Do they show up in the list in the beginning or if you open the mods list from the options menu?Do you have OneDrive on your computer? Make sure that the game is not using the OneDrive-folders. Try turning off OneDrive before starting the game.You can check where the game saves your files by looking in your Game Options - Screenshot settings.Make sure that the path above is the same place as where you have your saves and mods.

There was a universal issue in Sims 4 where at a point, the game stopped supporting mods altogether whether they were enabled or not. This caused a global outrage to players regarding the mod’s functionality and they were unable to customize their game in any way. Electronic Arts were fast to release an update that circumvented the issue. If you have an older version of Sims 4 installed, it is recommended that you follow the method below to update it to the latest build.
We have received numerous reports regarding the issue where Sims 4 mods fail to work. Either the game doesn’t pick up the mod files which you have pasted in the directory or the mod fails to initialize. We looked at several user reports and use cases to come to the conclusion that this issue occurred due to several different reasons.
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
@the_music_queen0 Please go into Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4, and confirm that there's no Mods folder. If there isn't, load the game, enable mods and cc, then quit. If these settings are already enabled, disable them, quit, then reload and reenable them. This should create a new Mods folder with a resource.cfg file inside. (If it doesn't, delete options.ini from your Sims 4 folder, load the game, enable mods and cc, and quit. But you'll need to reset your other in-game options as well.)When adding mods, be sure to test them in small batches, so you know they still work properly and don't crash your game. If one batch causes problems, you'll need to split it and keep testing until you find the issue. It's often easier to just download fresh copies of any mods you want to use. Their download pages should stat whether they've been updated for or confirmed to work with the current patch level, currently 1.60.

## The sims 4 mod folder was used to store mods created for the game, but it has now been deleted. this means all mods created for the game are now invalid.

When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.
Mods are a major part of Sims 4, adding endless new features, from personality tweaks to unlimited money. They let you bring fantasies to life and add depth to an already extensive sandbox simulation. However, sometimes, newly downloaded mods fail to show up in the game, and consequently, don’t work.
@Teenybober Do you know where your user data folder is? This Sims 4 folder, not the one with the game files but a separate folder in a different directory, stores saves, saved households and builds, screenshots, etc. as well as mods. The game itself should create a Mods folder by default there. In Windows and macOS, the user data is in Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4, although I have no idea if your setup would look different.If you're not sure where to find this content, load your game to the Main Menu, click Load Game, then hover over the folder icon under the name of your save. It will list the full file path to that save. So just find that same Sims 4 folder, and you should see a Mods folder inside.
I have a problem too with my mods folder. Yesterday I bought the sims 4 base game with the cats and dogs expansion pack , the location of mine sims 4 folder is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games and when i open it , it didnt have mods folder i made one and then i put my mods and cc the cc and mods that i have inside dont show up in my game and i have inside the mods folder the resource.cfg file but still they dont show up in my game . What can I do ? Do I need to buy all the packs ?
Hello, The Sims 4 has been running fine, however I wanted to uninstall it and start again. I read that I should delete a certain folder - so I deleted the Electronic Arts folder. Now when I enter The Sims 4 disc only certain folders open which do not let me play. I tried redeeming the product code again on Origin so I could download the game, but it wouldn't let me because you cannot use the code twice. I'm worried I have deleted the wrong folder and I have wasted money buying the game because I have deleted it! My laptop has windows 8 and I would like it if I could get rid of all my Sims 4 folders and be able to start again - install the game once more.Thanks,Grace.
This will open the Mods folder and automatically highlight the file you selected in Sims 4 Tray Importer. Just right-click the file and delete it. The Sims 4 Tray Importer will automatically delete the files in your Mods folder for you, but only if you downloaded the separated .package file instead of the merged file. If you downloaded the merged .package file, all of the mods will be deleted.
Sims 1, 2, and 3 also had the support for mod files and allowed users to customize their gameplay according to their will. However, it should be noted that older version mods are not supported by the newer versions of the game. For example, if you downloaded a mod for Sims 3, it will not be supported and played with Sims 4.
This ensures you have an updated copy of your game (Sims families and your mods) should you have to reinstall the game. It takes time to build up a collection, and it’s a nuisance to lose progress just like losing any saved data for any other video game.
