## Height slider for the sims 4 game.

Have you ever wanted to make your Sims look taller without messing with the animations? Well, here is a tool that will help you achieve that! This height slider allows you to increase or decrease the height of every individual Sim. It is created by Godjul1 and it has over two million downloads at ModTheSims. It’s also packed with additional features which you can check here!

Whenever you imagine slider mods, the first you will need to download is a decent ol’ height slider so you can truly alter the tallness of your characters. I thought that it was hard to stay aware of the various (broken and non-broken) stature sliders for Sims out there, so I chose to disentangle it and make it accessible in CAS!
And here’s an unconventional slider for Sims 4 that you might not know you needed. It’s a slider mod only for boots and heels, but it fits the game in a perfect way. It allows you to drag the boots your Sim is wearing in CAS and set their height. This mod works with boots CC which you can download too.
This particular mod, developed by the creator Luumia Sims, is a feature wanted by many users for long. With the Sims 4 height presets and the manual slider mod, you can edit height of Sims of any length depending on your needs. Obviously this Sims 4 tall mod works as a major game-changer and influences the manner in which the characters interact with each other or perform animations.
The first and original height slider mod for The Sims 4 is the one created by simmythesim at ModTheSims in 2015. Although this one is not as updated as the other height slider mods available, it sure is the one that paves the way for the development of other height mods that Simmers get to enjoy today.

The standard Create a Sim (CAS) game mode only allows adjustments on body mass and weight of your Sims. Here’s a solution: a Sims 4 height slider mod. In this article, we’ll go through this incredible type of Sims 4 modification. We’ll explain what it is all about, including the most popular height mods that you can download for your game.
This height slider modification further includes extras, which give a fuller game experience. First is the Neck Tall/Short Slider, which you can use to adjust the length of your Sims’ neck. What’s more, it can be used even without height mod though clipping issues can be expected.
The height slider is based off of simmythsims’ original Tall/Short slider, with a few tweaks. Sims’ midriff, head, hands, and feet now scale proportionately to the size of the body. This slider can be used by dragging the neck up and down from the front of the Sim.
Luumia’s version is more simple and easy to use than other different variations of a height slider mod. However, this mod for Sims 4 does not work for kids and toddlers. In other words, it only works for teens and older Sims. Updates from the original CAS mod includes the following:
