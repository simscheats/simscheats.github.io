## Sims 4 mods are a popular way to change the game.

You can find many mods over at ModTheSims, which hosts a wealth of community-made free mods for you to download and enjoy as you please. Installing mods is simple enough – all you need to do is drag the mod files over to the game’s mod folder. In a typical setup, this should be Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.

Modder Zero has a huge archive of free gameplay mods that are incredibly useful for expanding play in The Sims 4. Whether that’s improving upon Spellcasters, Ghosts, and Vampires, expanding Aliens into Time Lords from Doctor Who, or tweaking autonomy actions for your Sims, there’s a whole lot to choose from.
And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?
There's a mod called Wicked Whims that is pretty adult-themed but has a fair share of great tweaks that makes each sim in The Sims 4 all the more believable. Players who just want the family-friendly content present in this game should check out Wonderful Whims instead.
If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)

I remember downloading a free trial of Sims 4 and being really disappointed with it. Some of the mods sound like they should be included in the game already, such as the MC Command Center. However, reading this has gotten me all nostalgic for the older games, so I might give Sims 4 a try and keep these mods bookmarked to add after playing the original version for a bit. Thanks for the information.
The options for mods are pretty diverse. I've seen everything from one for The Sims 2 which added horses to the game (and yes, Sims could even ride them—and this was way before the Pets expansion pack added horses to The Sims 3), to one for Sims 3 which added in a working Ferris wheel. Some are much less complex, just restructuring the regular game files to add in or change things (like a Sims 3 mod which allows late-night bars to stay open 24 hours instead of closing at 2 a.m., or the most famous mod of all, the one that removes the pixelation on nude Sims and replaces it with body parts).
For mod fans who really want to get into the nitty-gritty details of playing The Sims then check out the MC Command Centre mega-mod by Deaderpool. This mod is a collection of smaller mods that give you the power to make small adjustments and tweaks to how sims live their lives.
You just need to look at the game’s strong library of user generated content to see what’s really keeping the lights on. The Sims 4 mods scene is thriving, with plenty of weird and wonderful additions to the base game. We’ve compiled a list of what we think are the best Sims 4 mods accompanied with links to all the download pages. Be sure to read the install instructions for each mod.

Genshin Impact is free-to-play with gacha mechanics and premium passes available. The game has remained incredibly popular in 2021, and Genshin Impact had an estimated 40 million players by the end of 2020. The game is currently available on mobile devices, PlayStation 4 and 5, and PC - with a long-awaited Nintendo Switch version presumably still in the works. Like most PC games, this means it's theoretically possible to create mods for Genshin Impact; however, this comes with a few caveats, and installing mods for Genshin Impact is not nearly as easy as it is for a game like Skyrim.
