## Mod manager for sims 4

If you ask why, then you’re on the right track to make your life a lot easier. You see, the Mod Manager is a quality of life, fully developed software that helps you organize all The Sims 4 files. If you’ve ever found yourself in the mess of all the additional mods and CC you download for the game, then this is your ticket out of that hell!

The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
And if you click on the furthermost tool in the same corner, the one labeled Open The Sims 4 “Mods” folder, you will be directed to the destination of your installed mod. Notice that if a mod isn’t checked/selected in the main list on the Mod Manger, then it won’t be shown in the folder either.
Sort your mods easier. But how?Basically, you can see this tool as a file explorer with additional features, for Sims 4 files. Like any other file explorer, you can select, delete or move files. However, with this program you can also disable/enable mods/CC (individually, multiple files or entire folders), view their thumbnails and use special filters.
After you install the program, the main framework that you’ll be using in it is called Manage Mods. If you click on it, an empty page will open up. Since you have just now installed it for the first time, you will need to import all of your mods and CC. That’s easily done through the little plus “+” button at the bottom left corner. But be aware that sometimes the program links to your Sims 4 folder, and if you already have mods and CC loaded to the game, they might appear on the page.

The Mod & Custom Content Manager is described as a file explore with additional features which allows you to browse your files for The Sims 4 easily. You are able to delete and move files but also disable and enables files both on their own, in multiples or even whole folders. View files alongside thumbnails, which will help you distinguish content that is for Build Buy Mode or Create A Sim.
This program is designed to help you bring order to your Sims 4 mod folder. It tries to extract thumbnails from the files or if that doesn't work, it searches for a thumbnail online. This is not always perfect, but helps to see what is included in a particular mod.
Sort your mods easier. But how?
Basically, you can see this tool as a file explorer with additional features, for Sims 4 files. Like any other file explorer, you can select, delete or move files. However, with this program you can also disable/enable mods/CC (individually, multiple files or entire folders), view their thumbnails and use special filters. With these filters you can first distinguish between: Create a Sim Item, Catalog/Build Mode Item or Other. In the case of Create a Sim Items, you can even differentiate more precisely into areas such as makeup, hair, shoes, etc., just like in the actual game.
What this means is that, you can load and unload certain mods and CC whenever you like. If you deselect a bunch of various mods, then the next time you start The Sims 4 you won’t find those mods in there! To turn them back on, just exit the game and check them once again. This amazing tool allows for so much freedom when it comes to dictating your gameplay and we recommend using it!

## Mods for sims 4

The Sims 4 has many unofficial mods and Custom Content that you can install to expand upon or improve gameplay, such as texture mods, new hairstyles and eye colors, custom houses, and more. This page teaches you everything you need to know about How to Install Mods in TS4 and where to find CC on PC and Mac.
However, if you’re a new Sims 4 player or you haven’t delved deep into the world of mods and CC, you might not even know where to start. The internet is full of shareable content for the game and it’s simply too overwhelming looking for mods on google.
Anyone who uses Mods or Custom Content in The Sims 4, or even from any of previous The Sims games, will know that your Mods folder can sometimes feel a little overwhelming. However, GameTimeDev has created a program to help players keep their Mods folder organized.
Those were the 25+ best websites and creators of Sims 4 CC on the internet! You can find more great mods in our overview. If you are wondering how and in which folder you should install all these wonderful mods and CC creations, you can find our guide here.
And the best website of CC and mods as well for Sims 4 is The Sims Resource. This is the goldmine when it comes to finding the best custom content for your particular Sim and household. As you can see, I listed some of the most popular creators on The Sims Resource here. However, there are tons of other creative people that share their designs. And whether it’s home decor or a specific hairstyle you’re looking for, I have no doubts that you’ll find it on TSR.
Tumblr is a treasure trove of custom content for The Sims 4, so it’s no surprise that we’ve included several Tumblr accounts in this list. The account of One Billion Pixel is the best address for you if you want to extend the game with great clutter creations. Once again, pictures are worth a thousand words. Below are some of the creations in the screenshot and the link to the website! You can also find more Clutter CC in our post about the best Clutter CC & Mods!
The online Sims community has been growing for over a decade now. There are tons of Sims 4 creators and custom content websites where you can find mods and CC for your game play. But there are also a lot of fans like us that search for these extensions and custom content for the game.
Mods and CC are the essential components that make it possible that The Sims 4 is still one of the most successful games, even after almost ten years. Because: Electronic Arts (EA) regularly offers new great content. But without the huge selection and boundless creativity of the community, The Sims 4 would still only be half as exciting!
