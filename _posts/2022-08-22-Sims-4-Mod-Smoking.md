## Allow players to smoke in the game.

Avoid compromising situations. Paul said, “Flee fornication” (1 Corinthians 6:18). You must apply this same principle to smoking. Avoid situations where you previously “lit up”! Don’t let other smokers, friends, relatives or stressful situations cause you to cave in to your old habit. Remember, just one puff will make you a habitual smoker again!

Stop all smoking completely. Tapering the amount you smoke doesn’t work for most people. Smoking is an addiction. Trying to quit gradually only feeds the addiction. You should quit suddenly and totally! It is not easy to quit suddenly, but it is the most successful way. Commit yourself to quitting. Throwaway all cigarettes, snuff or pipe tobacco. Get rid of all those things that focus your attention on smoking such as favorite lighters, cigarette cases or pipes. Then never buy another ounce of tobacco!
Smoking breaks the Tenth Commandment. As Mr. Armstrong wrote, a smoker can hardly claim that he smokes to please others. People smoke to satisfy the self. Smoking is a desire, a thirst for self-gratification. It is lust! Jesus Christ taught that we must uphold the spirit of the law (Matthew 5:27-28). In other words, we must be concerned just as much with what goes on in our minds as with our actions.
Spend time with non-smokers and people who will support your efforts to remain free of cigarettes! Another way to get your mind off your smoking habit is to replace it with some other activity. Studies have shown that it is much easier to break a bad habit and stay free of returning to that bad habit if we have something to replace it with. Try getting involved in some type of exercise program like walking, cycling or swimming, depending upon your age, athletic ability and health. Getting a physical check-up is a good idea before beginning any new exercise program. This is an excellent replacement habit.
Many people say that they cannot stop smoking. That is not true! Yes, you can stop smoking! How can you stop? Here is the method you should use. First, recognize that smoking is a sin that will keep you out of the Kingdom of God. Paul said, “For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God” (Ephesians 5:5). Smoking is covetousness and, as Paul stated here, idolatry!

Realize that sin no longer has power over the truly converted person (Romans 6:14): God promises to cleanse us of sin, if we are willing to confess our sin. “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). In other words, God has obligated Himself to cleanse us of the sin of smoking if we repent, acknowledge our sin and call upon Him for the extra help we need. Learn to fully utilize the power available to you from God. God will help you, if you humbly pray to Him for help (Psalm 103:11-14; Isaiah 55:7-8).
Many countries and many U.S. states have passed laws banning smoking in public places for this reason. Smokers not only ruin their own health but the health of others as well. Smokers do harm to others—another definite violation of the Sixth Commandment.
Besides lung cancer, you could also be subjecting your body to other life-threatening diseases such as bladder cancer, emphysema, high blood pressure and hardening of the arteries which can lead to a stroke. From God’s point of view, is there really any difference between pointing a gun to your head and pulling the trigger or lighting a cigarette? No! Pulling the trigger on a gun usually brings death instantly. But smoking also brings death—slow, agonizing death. Both are suicide! Both are a violation of the Sixth Commandment. If you are smoking, the most important thing you can do for your health is to quit the poisonous habit immediately.
If you smoke or use any other form of tobacco, then you are doing so contrary to the serious warnings against such habits. When you smoke, you are wrecking your health. Another of the Surgeon General’s warnings on a pack of cigarettes states: “Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health.”

## Create a smoking mod for the sims 4.

The sims 4 smoking mod is currently the most requested mod by simmers to spice up the gangster vibe inside the game but yet there isn’t a functional one. (Functional smoking mod available- check below!) The requirements for this mod to work will be two additional mods which is commonly used in the sims community The Pose Player and The Teleporter.

Ever wanted to be a drug dealer in Sims 4? Now here’s your simmie’s chance. This functional weed mod would let the player grow weed, harvest them, sell and buy weed and includes a clubber trait for smoking them.

The Sims has always allowed you to toy with your creations’ lives in sickly satisfying ways. But this new mod helps you mess with them in a new, insane, slightly entertaining manner. Your Sims can now take a hit from a bong. A new mod for “The Sims 4” lets players equip their avatars with the “drug dealer” trait, which allows them to buy, sell and use drugs like weed, cocaine and MDMA. They can also experience the highs and lows of drugs like dealing with addiction and overdoses. The mod was created by an amateur coder, who now racks in $6,000 a month from donations through his company “Basemental.”
Roll up a joint or a blunt, make sure you have a high enough friendship level with the person that your Sim wanting to smoke with, have them both sit down on the sofa, click on the other Sim, press drugs, and then there should be an option to share a joint or blunt with the other Sim.
