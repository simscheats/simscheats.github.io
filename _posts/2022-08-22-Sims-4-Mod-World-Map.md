## Create a world map for your sims 4 mod.

Do you feel like The Sims 4 Maps are missing out on a few more details? You’re in luck because a talented graphic designer FilipeSims has been working for months to bring you new Maps that you can use in your game! With the help from DerShayan these Maps have been implemented into a simple .package file – more specifically, each World Map redesign is packed into one .package specifically. However, all of these Maps can be downloaded on one simple page that we’ve linked down below.

All of the maps from The Sims 4 have been redesigned, including the ones that we’ve received with Expansion Packs and Game Packs. To download these fanmade maps, simply click on the button down below to be directed to the Map Download page. From there select the Maps of your choice, download them from SimFileShare and extract them to Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods folder. Make sure that you’ve enabled Mods / CC in your game options!
Filipe Marcel, one of many fan-made map creators in the community, has released brand new custom designs of the World Maps for The Sims 4. Back in August 2018 he had only released the base game replacements, but fast forward to 2019, and he has now released all 12 world maps for the game. If you’d like to add them to you game, download here!
Though the Sims 4 has slowly been introducing new worlds with DLC, fans have been lacking world customisation and variety since the game was released. The Sims 3 had the amazing create-a-world tool, which allowed players to create their own Sims 3 worlds from scratch. Even The Sims 2 had the ability to create custom neighborhoods. Sims 4 is seriously lacking any such feature, and chances of ever getting one is pretty slim.
While previous versions of The Sims have allowed you to create your own, custom worlds – whether through developer-provided tools or imports out of SimCity – Sims 4 players have had to await new DLC to bring new worlds to the game. But the option to create custom worlds is finally on the way, brought to us by modders.

TwistedMexi has been building a Sims 4 create a world tool for the past two years under the codename Project Raven, and it’s finally ready to be shown to players. A reveal trailer (noted by SimsVIP) shows off all the features you can expect when the alpha version launches on October 21.
You’ll be able to wipe an existing world clean, and rebuild it with the buildings, landscape items, and objects of your choice. You’ll be able to choose the exact placement of everything from background buildings, wilderness elements, sprite-based background trees, and even individual street elements like mailboxes. It looks like there’s even a procedural generation feature that’ll automatically fill in bits of the world that you don’t want to mess with.
I used The Tropical Getaway Mod and turned Granite Falls (from the Outdoor Retreat pack) into a beach world. There's a LOT of beach-themed lots in the gallery (some specifically for this mod pack) so I put some of my favourites into the game. I hope we get an official beach world in the game soon, but until then, this is a great option!
First Snow Mod by Sim Cookie transforms your game into a winter environment. All worlds in the game will be replaced with "snow" on the ground and icy trees. Even the cars and background features have snow on them! This is a beautiful mod for all the snow lovers out there!
