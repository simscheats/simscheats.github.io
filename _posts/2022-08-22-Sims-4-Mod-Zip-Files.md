## Sims 4 mods can be zip files.

Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.

as soon as i got sims 4, i went on a rampage and download any hair, sims, clothing, lots, etc that i liked and put a load of them in my mods folder at once. (not such a smart idea) but yeah, i’ve just started to screenshot my downloaded cc’s and giving them the same name as the package files to keep them organized. (it is a headache! i tell ya. #dedication aha)
Backing up Saved Games, Mods, and CCYou can backup your Mods and CC just as you can Save files, and it's smart to do this in case of disaster. Copy them to another drive or a USB stick and they're safe from hard drive failure. Head to your Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4 folder. Right click each of those three important folders - Saves, Tray, and Mods. Copy them then paste in a new location, where you know to find them. Should you have to reinstall the game or wipe everything, you've got a copy of your Sims families, and kept your collection of CC and Mods. These are precious because it takes time to build up a collection, and losing dozens of downloads can be a major nuisance.
When you start downloading CC, you'll notice that many of the files end in names like .zip, .rar, .7s, and so on. These files have been compressed by the custom content creator so you can download them and put them into your game. However, you can't just place a .rar or .zip file straight into your Sims 4 game. Therefore, you'll need a tool to extract these files.
Unless the page says not to, you use winrar or 7-zip as popular choices to extract the files inside. Packages to into the mod folder. Some mods require the zip files stay zipped to function otherwise they won't work, to figure this out read the description for the mod on instructions.

A lot of the sites, modders and creators upload to require that the .package file be zipped up into either a .rar or .zip format. Nothing we can do about that, but as others have said, just use a free unzip program (personally I like WinRAR) to extract the file from the zipped up folder. Just be sure to read each mod's description page to make sure that the mod needs to be extracted or if you need to leave it zipped up for it to work correctly! Typically its just script mods that need to stay zipped but not always! Good luck and happy Simming!
This method is a bit risky, and one I only recommend to experienced modders of The Sims. Merging files really can speed up your loading time, but it can also cause issues, as there's no way to "un-merge" files once you merge them, and if one of the files breaks within your merged file, you'll have to delete everything merged with it to get rid of the problematic file.
Hey, I have been able to get as far as getting my .package files through to Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods. The Recourse.cfg is not allowing any of mods to be downloaded, therefore I cannot get them into the game. What am I supposed to do ?
Hi Adrian, thank you for letting me know about that! Sadly a lot of sites have plagiarised my work (I can see they even used my same screenshot of my Sims 4 folder, lol). I'll send them a copyright infringement letter straight away. Thanks for the head's up! :)

## Sims 4 mods can be installed with a mod manager such as mod organizer.

Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
Installing Mods and Custom Content in The Sims 4 is very easy for both PC and Mac, if your aren’t sure how to do it, I wrote a quick but detailed tutorial for you to read. Most of the Mods or Custom Content files you can download are .package or .pyo/.py files that come in a compressed ZIP or RAR format.
The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
First off, to install mods, you will need to download the file. If the file is a zip file, you will need to extract it. Take the extracted file and place it in the mods folder for The Sims 4. To find the mods folder, go to your Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods. Script mods can only have one subfolder, which is usually the folder of the specific mod you downloaded. Do NOT create a subfolder within The Sims 4 Mods folder because the mods may not work in the game.
With the previous versions of Sims 4 Mod Organizer or Manager, the installation of package mods first required you to extract “Package” files from somewhere & add them alongside the mod organizer. However, in the latest version of the TS4MM or The Sims 4 Mod Manager, this particular step has been removed. If the mods or package mods downloaded by you are contained inside the “.rar”, “.zip”, or “.7z” archive, one can simply drag the same into the manager and add the same with a button.
