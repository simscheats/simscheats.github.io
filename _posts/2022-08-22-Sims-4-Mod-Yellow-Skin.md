## Create and save mods for the sims 4 game.

“The Sims 4: How To Ensure a Healthy Game” by SrslySims: This article is a must read for any mod or CC user who has the basics of this article down but is looking for more advanced knowledge on how to further consolidate and organize their mods and CC. SrslySims goes over many things that are not covered in this basic guide for beginners, like merging your package files and removing special characters from file names in order to alleviate strain on performance.

If you’re a Sims player who’s never delved into the world of mods and CC before, getting started with customizing your game can feel overwhelming. Where do you even start looking? Where do all those files go? Don’t mods and CC give you viruses? What do all these techy terms mean? Why do all your mods keep breaking whenever you update the game? How do you fix it?
The become a sorcerer mod was created by TriplisSims (Patreon) and is a fun way to play with magic, even if you don’t have The Sims 4: Realm of Magic in your game. It allows you to learn all sorts of spells and sorcery and do a bunch of cool stuff and it all starts with a small lump of clay.
The number one thing you need to know about mods is that they break. They break a LOT. After almost every single game update, in fact. This means that you’ll be redownloading your mods constantly. If this sounds like too much hassle for you, then mods are probably not for you. If you are willing to keep your Mods folder maintained on a regular basis, then continue reading!
In The Sims 4 we are only given 3 slots for choosing traits for our sims which is a down grade from 5 in The Sims 3, which is disappointing. Thankfully, modders like Vicky Sims (patreon) create mods that you can use to add more traits which can help give your sims more personality.

The create a sim system in The Sims 4 is the best one we’ve ever gotten, but it is still pretty limited. Thankfully, modders like Vibrant Pixels have created body sliders that can be used to drag body parts further than you are able to just with the game functions.
When we moved from The Sims 3 to The Sims 4, one of the things that I missed the most (and there are a lot of things we all miss, of course) was the fact that the traits you could assign to your Sims decreased from six to three. But, thanks to this mod from chingyu1023 (opens in new tab) (based on the original from Embyr311 (opens in new tab), which hasn't been updated since 2016) that lets you add more Create a Sim traits, there's a way to get back to the standards that The Sims 3 set.
This one isn't going to change your game, but more help you keep your Sim creations safe. This Daily Save mod (opens in new tab) from temptest literally just autosaves your game with every new Sim day. Using the default settings it'll just save the game at 5am every Sim Day and actually uses seven rotating save slots, just in case you want to roll back to a specific day within the last Sim week. A handy little mod if I ever saw one.
The extreme violence mod was created by Sacrificial Mods (Patreon) and will add tons of new ways for your sims to die. The deaths in the sims are very PG and you’ll never see true violence, but you can create killer sims who will go around and hit sims with cars, electrocute them and so much more.

## Download mods for the sims 4 game.

From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.

Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
You should never have to pay for any sims 4 mods ever, this includes custom content too. There are actually rules that come directly from EA that state that you are not allowed to have things behind permanent pay walls and are only allowed to have these items on early access on things like Patreon but you must eventually make these items available for free.
These sims 4 mods have all been in my game at some point and have all brought me immense amounts of joy in the game. I absolutely love adding sims 4 mods because the game can get stale if you playa every single day for years and years. Hopefully you enjoyed this list of mods and it can inspire you to play something more exciting!
The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience. Although the game is fun enough on its own (there's plenty of stuff you can do in The Sims 4 already), it gets even better when you're able to have more meaningful conversations, or fix the lag that's been bothering you. We selected some of the handiest, most entertaining, and most beautiful Sims 4 mods out there. Check the list to see which ones you like best, and you can install them right away!
Have you ever wanted to play The Sims 4 as a multiplayer game with your friends? Well, there’s a whole mod that lets you host a multiplayer game for up to twelve players and you’ll be able to see everything the other person is doing in your save file.
Since sims 4 mods aren’t created by or maintained by EA there is always a chance that something in a mod can conflict with the way the game operates, especially since The Sims 4 is consistently updated. You want to find sims 4 mods that are consistently updated too because mods can break often, and can break your game if they aren’t updated.
