## Create a mod that allows players to have multiple jobs in the sims 4.

The Sims 4 allows players to create their own tiny little simulated people, and give them jobs that they can hold down simultaneously. However, some creators have taken this a step further by giving the AI characters multiple careers at once. This article covers how to do it and what are the pros/cons of doing so.

We know how sometimes it feels a bit frustrating when the career and job options in The Sims 4 are limited. Good thing tons of awesome job and career mods are easily available for download – thanks to the creative minds of mod creators! If you’re on the hunt for the best Sims 4 job and career mods, we’ve got some good news! This article puts together the best one we’ve found across several sources. Check them out below!
This mod allows your sim to have more than one job at a time. This means that they can do all their favorite things and get paid for it It also brings with it new careers, part-time jobs, and freelance trades for you to add to your gameplay. If you are looking for some ways to spice up your gameplay and make it more realistic then this might be what you were looking for! With this mod, your sim can join as many different careers as they want at once and do them all simultaneously. However, they will still need to manage their time wisely so that they can balance their work-life with their personal life. Head over to this page for easy download.
As you can see, Sims can’t have more than one full-time job or career at a given time. Of course, this question makes perfect sense. More jobs means more money. And the more money your Sim has, the better. They can use it to upgrade their lifestyle and purchase expensive items.
Another interesting modification in this list is the Law Career Mod, especially if you’re a fan of all those “law and legal” tv shows. It is a very popular job modification that many players use in the community and now has over 190,000 downloads. Install this entertaining mod and have your Sims choose between four career tracks: attorney, in-house, public prosecution, and judge. The good news? Only the base game is required to use this in The Sims 4. Download the mod at ModTheSims.

Can a Sim have two jobs in The Sims 4? Sims cannot have two full-time jobs or multiple full-time jobs in The Sims 4. They can pursue only one specific career path full-time. They cannot hold one full-time job and a part-time job either. However Sims can have two part-time jobs at once.
I’m pretty sure you’re not the only one wishing for more career options for your Sims. Sure, there are a lot of careers included in the base game, but this mod has more options that have been missed by the developers. With four new career paths for firefighters, hotel employees, stylists, and private tutors to the game, the mod package makes a great addition for fans of a larger variety of career paths. These mods, published by sims-blog.de, have more than 300,000 downloads to date at ModTheSims, making them one of the most popular mods in the community. To download the modifications, just go to this page.
A new mod has been created for the game The Sims 4 that will allow your sim to have their own Youtube channel. Your sim can upload videos of themselves playing games, DIY or makeup tutorials, and more. They can also update their channel with blog posts, vlogs, and live streams to keep up their gamer, DIY, or MUA cred on top of having a full-time job. Another cool thing about this mod is that it will let your sim go vlogging and make videos of their everyday life. To take your Sim down this career path, know that they will struggle. So, you need to have some patience. Check it out on this page.
With over 363,000 downloads at ModTheSims, the Self-Employment Career Mod is definitely one of the popular ones in the Sims community. This mod is created by Neia, an active mod maker with many other career mods included in this list. This mod mainly fills the career panel for self-employed Sims when asked what they do for a living. I like this mod because it undoubtedly adds something valuable and unique to the game. It is unavailable in the basic game. Give this mod a chance too, and it is really worth a try! You only need just the base game to use this one. You may download the file at ModTheSims.

## Create a mod that allows players to have multiple sims in the sims 4.

If you aren’t sure where to start, then you have nothing to worry about. The first step is to download the actual mod. The file should be copy-pasted to your Mods folder inside your Sims 4 directory. After that, just head over into the game and check the “Script Mods Allowed” option, which can be located in the “Settings Other”. And you’re all done!
And then you have to think about each of the Sim’s personalities and how you’re going to build the home for them. If you’re having trouble with this, we’re totally recommending these 5 ideas to improve your building. They can come in pretty handy, especially if you’re using the Sims 4 household limit mod!
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
The mod that we use to increase the household limit in Sims 4 is called Full House Mod. You may have heard of it since it’s a very popular tool shared among the community. Its creator is TwistedMexi and the mod has been a part of the game since 2014. It works properly even to this day and we heavily recommend it to you!
In Sims 4, we have the freedom to create as many families as we want. We can find them peaceful neighborhoods, build them cozy homes, and even send them on vacations. But we can’t always create the ideal family for ourselves, simply because of one silly rule – the household number limit! And the only way to remove the household limit in Sims 4 is to use a mod!
The Full Hosue mod is one of the most useful tools for The Sims 4. And even if you aren’t planning on creating a 20-Sims family, the option to have as many Sims as you want in your household is pretty amazing. We’ve played with this mod since the start of the game and we’ll keep on doing so until the end. So get yourself some more cats, dogs, aliens, vampires, and what not! Happy simming!
This method is a bit risky, and one I only recommend to experienced modders of The Sims. Merging files really can speed up your loading time, but it can also cause issues, as there's no way to "un-merge" files once you merge them, and if one of the files breaks within your merged file, you'll have to delete everything merged with it to get rid of the problematic file.
