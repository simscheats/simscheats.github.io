I upgraded to windows 10 almost 2 weeks ago and and was excited that my sims 4 still worked flawlessly and the Sims 4 Mod Manager was working as well.......Until about 3 days ago. Out of no where the mod manager stopped working correctly. Every time I run the program, it opens up but it wont display on my screen, it's just stuck on my task-bar. I have re-downloaded it a ton of times, and yes i turned my computer off and on again (it didn't work). Is this a bug, or is it a compatibility issues? It worked for about a week and a half but then just stooped working out of no where.
The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
MC Command Center is a mod in the Sims 4 that allows players to have a much higher level of control over their game. While this mod can be extremely useful, it can be a bit finicky due to the amount of work that goes into it. There are a few reasons why MC Command Center may not be working:
Hello! So, I just installed more CC & Mods for my current household and for some reason whenever I go into build mode it looks like the image I added, and it loads slow.I also can't place any objects, walls/floors, or anything except for rooms. It doesn't deduct from my money count when I try to. Everything just turns invisible or doesn't want to place. I also can't interact with sims and tell them to do anything with another sim, most of the time it works for objects but it's really a 50/50, just super slow for the game to respond to my inputs. and it's super frustrating because I'm trying to use MCCC to set stuff up, but it doesn't seem to be working.note: I have a modded game with over 4000+ cas/build mode objects in my folder. I tried using The Sims 4 Mod Manager to try to see the problem, but it doesn't seem to catch anything besides duplicate or corrupted files. Also, Last Exceptions and Better Exceptions hadn't caught anything, so I don't know what it is. note2: Also Also Whenever I load an household it keeps saying "Items Removed: one or more create a sim items have been removed. The items may not be installed on your computer or the Origin account that's logged in doesn't currently own these items."That's all.edit: forgot the screenshot

## Your mod files are damaged.

If the steps above don’t alleviate the issue, you may need to check the mod compatibility. This can usually be done on the mod’s download page. Make sure the downloaded mod version corresponds with your current game version and that you’ve made the necessary game updates.
Bad mods: If there are any corrupt or bad mods in your mods directory, there is a possibility that the entire batch of mods will not work. Here we have to apply a technique where we test each mod one by one to find the culprit and disregard it from the folder.
If all the above methods don’t work, it is possible that your mod list contains a problematic mod that is causing issues. In this solution, we will try to create a new user settings folder in your computer and after copying the major old configurations, test each mod one by one. If there is any problematic mod, we will be able to detect it and remove it. This method will require that you analyze each case very carefully and will cause it to be tedious so make sure you have plenty of time.
Hi @lovelucidly,Make sure Origin is not set to disable the mods:Right click on the game in your game library in Origin, and go to Properties.Go to Advanced launch settings tabIs there anything written in the Command line arguments option? If you find something related to mods, like "-mods", delete it.Was that the problem?Mai
Before we start with any other solution, we will check whether the mod files which you have placed in the mods folder are in the correct format. Normally, the format in which the mod files are when you download them from the creator’s website is .zip. The reason why the game cannot view and operate the contents of the .zip file is that the game engine is not designed to unzip the package each and every time as this will consume a lot of time and CPU energy.
Every game has a cache folder which it uses for its operations and the running of the game. Since the cache files are created at runtime and may be leftover, there are chances that some of them get corrupt. When this occurs, the game causes unexpected behavior including the mods not working as required. In this solution, we will navigate to the cache folder and clear it.
In this article, we will go through all the possible causes of the issue and what you can do to fix it. If you face a similar problem, start from the first solution and work your way down accordingly. The solutions are written in terms of simplicity and the usefulness of the actions. Make sure that you are logged in as an administrator before proceeding.
@Elly_00922 It's always possible your download was corrupted, so please delete the nonworking mod, download a fresh copy, add it to the Mods folder, and test.If that doesn't help, please let me know where AllCheats isn't showing up. Do any of its commands work at all?
Launch your game and see if CC is visible. If it is, you can start by placing the script mods one at a time and see which one works and which ones doesn’t. This way you will be able to diagnose which one is causing the issue and you can replace it accordingly.

## Your mod files are not associated with the sims 4 game folder.

@Queen_Mia1228 Do you run the standard version of Sims 4, or the Legacy Edition? If you have the standard version, you'll need to make sure your mods are fully updated for the current patch. If you have the LE, you'll need to specifically download mods made for or confirmed to be compatible with the LE; the newer ones won't work.
Hence you should navigate to the mod’s website and make sure that the mod which you downloaded is indeed that of Sims 4 and not of the earlier versions. You can easily check this by seeing the changelog or the category in which they are placed. Identify the incompatible mods and remove them.
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.
If your mods won’t work after installing the latest Sims 4 updates, make sure to update them to the latest version and unzip your mod packages. Then, clear your game cache and repair your Sims 4 game files. Check if your mod list includes a faulty mod and delete it. You can also create a new household and reinstall the game.
@Queen_Mia1228 If you are going to use mods it's always best to follow the instructions from the mod creator's website rather than using YouTube (unless the mod creator posted the YouTube video, of course). The best mod creators will update or verify compatibility for their mods after each game patch whereas the YouTube videos can be older and contain obsolete information.Make sure your .package or .ts4script files are in your Mods folder. For most people, it should be like this:Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 ModsMake sure that anything with a script file is no more than one level deep in the Sims 4 mod folder structure. The Sims 4 will only go one-level deep when looking for script mods.Also, go to your game options and make sure script mods and custom content are enabled, then restart your game.Mods can be lots of fun to use but they do require proper updates and maintenance or they can break your game save.
Another thing to check is the mod compatibility with your current Sims 4 game. We came across several different cases where the mod author didn’t update the existing version of the mod to be compatible with the latest version of Sims which caused the mod to conflict and not work as expected. Navigate to the official mod website and check if the current version of the mod which you have been using is working properly in Sims 4. You can also take a look at different forums.
We have received numerous reports regarding the issue where Sims 4 mods fail to work. Either the game doesn’t pick up the mod files which you have pasted in the directory or the mod fails to initialize. We looked at several user reports and use cases to come to the conclusion that this issue occurred due to several different reasons.
In this case, you should create a new household and check if it can load the mods. If Sims 4 mods not working issue disappear, it will be sure that this issue is caused by the household problem. You can give up the original household and use the new one.
There was a universal issue in Sims 4 where at a point, the game stopped supporting mods altogether whether they were enabled or not. This caused a global outrage to players regarding the mod’s functionality and they were unable to customize their game in any way. Electronic Arts were fast to release an update that circumvented the issue. If you have an older version of Sims 4 installed, it is recommended that you follow the method below to update it to the latest build.

## The mod manager is not functional on your computer.

Is anyone else having this issue? If it is a compatibility issue is there another manager I can download to replace the old one? Or have some one figured out how to make this one work? I can always install my mods manually but the mod manager made it easier to find mods that can break or glitch my game.
Hello! I finally found a fix to this problem myself, running in compatibility mode for Windows 7 didn't work, but randomly I tried forcing the mod manager to run in a maximised window which fixed it for me. To use this "fix:" 1. Find the shortcut on your desktop or your install location for the mod manager. 2. Right click the icon and press "properties." 3. Go under the section called "shortcut." 4. Locate the option called "Run," and change it to "Maximized." - This will hopefully fix the mod manager for you as well, I myself have had my mod conflict detector stop working as well, which I have yet to fix.
BirdyBirdy I am having the same problem with the mod manger can some one plz help It was just working for me and randomly stopped and I deleted it and downloaded it again and I also restarted computer nothing happen every time I try open mod manger it just stays at the bottom of my screen that all It want fully open any more I was just using it to!
I ran into this problem today, and I've come up with a few solutions. The root cause is that the default folder that Nexus Mod Manager wants to install into is not typically writable by normal users. They want you to install into a subfolder of C:\, and if you don't have administrator rights, chances are you can't create the "Games" folder you need (C:\Games).
Put your Nexus Mod Manager files somewhere else. If you install to some subdirectory of your home directory, you won't have to worry about permissions and so forth. When the Mod Manager asks you where you want to save the mod files, pick someplace under C:\Users(your user name)\ or C:\Documents and Settings(your user name), depending on the version of Windows you're using. You could potentially put this in your Documents folder, but I have "projects" folder I created in my home directory, which works well for me.
Hi so I’m having a similar problem. On my windows 10, I downloaded all my mods accordingly, put them in the mods folder, and played about 2 months ago. However, this afternoon, the mods were not working. I deleted them all after trying to re-zip the files, then re-downloaded them. I did the same things to install them but they’re still not showing up whatsoever and it’s really annoying lol. Anyone can help me with this? Also, please simplify any answers im really stupid lol...
The config file for Nexus Mod Manager is stored in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Black_Tree_Gaming - you can copy and paste this into the address bar of Windows Explorer to go there, or paste it into the "Run" or "Search" dialog on the Start menu. Alternatively, from your user's home directory, look for "AppData" and then "Local" and then "Black_Tree_Gaming"
The Mod Checker is software that scans your entire Mods folder and discovers the broken CC files automatically. It will list all of your CC and mods from your Mods folder, and it will show which of your downloads are outdated or broken. You can then go to those folders and manually delete them.
