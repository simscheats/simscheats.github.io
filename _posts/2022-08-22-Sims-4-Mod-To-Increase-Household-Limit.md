## Sims 4 players can now increase their household limit to up to 10 sims.

This Sims 4 mod lets you have up to 24 Sims in one house, which is your new household limit. However, we’ve found that 24 is enough for almost all types of gameplay, so it shouldn’t be much of a problem. And the reason why the creator has included this rule is just to make sure that our systems can run the game with so many Sims active in one place without crushing.

Special thanks to the following folks who helped me at one point or another with this mod, or something relating to it. They are, in no particular order: Candyd, Neia, DramaticGamer, SimGuruModSquad, CmarNYC, Hadron1776, Turbodriver, KlingonDragon, WildWitch, Scumbumbo, Fogity.
The mod now uses a script file again. It's imperative for allowing the ability to change a sim's name without going into CAS, as part of the Subjugated Sim "Change Name" Spell (see Domination Specialization notes for more info). Credit and a big thank you to Scumbumbo for creating the script that enabled me to do this and for giving me permission to use it.
Be careful when adding more sims to your household using MCCC. If you do, do not enter CAS using the regular way. Click on the sim you want to edit and go to MCCC Sim Commands Modify in CAS. If you enter CAS the traditional way, you risk losing the sims you added and it can cause errors in your save. Deaderpool has more info about this feature on his website.
I removed the need for two of the overrides used in the mod by using scripts. In the process, I made it so that in the case of being immune to fire spreading to them, now both sims who have the Aura of Nature active will be immune and so will sims who have the Reaper Garb (from Destruction level 5) active. I felt this was a nice little touch fitting for a destructive sim going on a firey rampage.
Added a Mass version of Dispel Enchantment, found under Spells Mass. This can be used to dispel Stasis Field easily on a lot of sims at once, if you've used the Mass version of Stasis Field. It will also dispel any other spells that are built to involve the Dispel Enchantment command.
