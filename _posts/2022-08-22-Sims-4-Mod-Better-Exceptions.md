## The better exceptions mod for the sims 4 makes exceptions easier to handle.

Community modder TwistedMexi has released a new mod that will make troubleshooting The Sims 4 more straightforward. Aptly named “Better Exceptions“, the mod has the ability to monitor and alert players of exceptions the moment they occur, making it easier to correlate the error to the cause. If an exception occurs, the mod compares it to a list of both known EA bugs and mod issues. If it finds a match, it will let players know the reason and offer steps to correct it, such as linking an Answers HQ article or the modder’s website.

@saeso7 Hi! It is safe to delete the exception files. They are generated when there is an error in the game's script or errors from mods and CC. If you encounter a problem in your game, you may be able to find clues as to the cause of the error in the exception files. Most times though, you may not even realize anything has happened. Have you ever noticed some or all the sims in a room suddenly reset? That's an example of one such glitch or error in the game.
Even if players encounter a new type of error, Better Exceptions will attempt to diagnose the most likely cause and let the player know. If there aren’t any mods installed, it will recommend that players report it as a game bug which will hopefully increase the rate that issues are found and corrected.
Skyrim is one of the easiest games on PC to mod thanks to its integration with the Steam Workshop. All you need to do is follow the links we’ve provided to the Workshop pages and ‘Subscribe’ to the mod. This will download and apply the mod to your game with no fuss at all.

I've been using twisted mexi's better exceptions mod and I noticed that all of my other mods are gone when I go into the game. It doesn't show MCCC, Slice of Life, WooHoo Wellness/Wicked Wellness and Extreme Violence. I have them in my mods folder, but they arent there when I pull up Sims. I had gotten BE because I was not able to click on the sim I was playing as (like if you wanted them to go for a walk or "yell forbidden words") but once I downloaded BE I was able to click on my sims again. Is there something wrong with the mods I have or is it something else?
@AalyahReedThe last exception shows when some mod or CC interferes with the game..Unfortunately, this also appears when it catches an error in the EA script.If you have already checked mods and CC now you can delete localthumbcache.package file in the game folder and fix the game in Origin what will check EA files... This file will recreate but without saved errors.After this, if your game is working in your place, I would not care about this.I don't work for EA
We’ve put together a comprehensive list of the best Skyrim mods we think are essential to improving Skyrim above and beyond the out-the-box experience. They’ll make the vanilla 2011-released game look better than even the 2016 Special Edition version. And, best of all, every one of these Skyrim mods is free! No wonder there’s been over one billion mod downloads between Skyrim and Fallout.
Where do I find Last Exceptions files? There are several types of Last Exception Files. The most common type of Last Exception files are the game’s Last Exception file, MC_lastexception.html file, and/or the BE-ExceptionsReport file. Below is where they are located in game. (File path is the same for both PC and Mac)

## The better exceptions mod improves the flow of work in the sims 4.

@saeso7 The information in them will be updated when new errors are detected, so it is good to cut the files out from The Sims 4 user folder after each play session, and paste them into another folder on your computer, in case you ever have a serious error that you want to ask help for. For bug reports etc it can sometimes be useful to provide dem, especially if you can remember what happened in game.
There are two flavors of this new mod, one mod stops ALL Sims from using their phones constantly while doing other tasks while the other flavor stops all EXCEPT teen Sims from constantly using their phones. Both flavors have the added feature of stopping your Sims from randomly changing the color of their phones no matter what age group they’re in.
This mod aims to band-aid the issue. Any Sim who has their "age progress" set to an invalid amount (which is what causes the error) will have their age progress reset to 0. This means that if a Young Adult Sim was about to age up, they are now at the start of their Young Adult age span once more. Unfortunately, since I do not know what is causing the Sims to have invalid age progress data in the first place, I cannot recover what the value should be. Nonetheless, Sims without the invalid data should be left alone.
Mods are much more than mere visual enhancers as they can fundamentally change the way the game operates. These mods change the way you play Skyrim, from adding new methods of attacking, through different ways to traverse the world, and altering the way the user interface works.
A massive mod comprised of numerous Workshop files, Static Mesh Improvement works absolute wonders in removing all those horrible niggles from the objects of the world. Edges have their angles worked away so stones are finally smooth and bowls made round. Textures now run smoothly and those unsightly seams when two textures meet are eradicated. The extra polygons will affect performance slightly, but this really should be at the top of your priorities when it comes to making Skyrim beautiful.

Finally, because the nature of this mod might mean many changes in the future, TwistedMexi has built in an auto-update feature. This helps ensure the mod remains as useful as possible without requiring players to manually check for updates frequently.TwistedMexi has invited both modders and users of the mod to provide screenshots of alerts and the reports as a way to increase the accuracy of the mod. If you’re a CC hoarder or mod fanatic, consider this mod an essential. Players can download the mod from his patreon.
Installing BE should have nothing to do with being able to click your sims. It sounds like the issue may be resolved because your other mods are disabled for some reason. Do you have scripts enabled? Are you getting mc_lastexception files? That would be the easiest way to find the problem mods. Mods not showing could be a few things, one drive being connected, script mods being disabled, an extra documents/ EA folder, an extra mods folder, a folder named "mods" in your mods folder. It's really hard to diagnosis issues like this without a lot of info. If you use discord, the Sims after dark discord server is a great place to get help, deaderpool's server, too. Oh and also, extreme violence (and most other mods by sacrificial) is currently broken , so definitely remove that. SOL is iffy, too
