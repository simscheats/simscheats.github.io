## Create a sims 4 mod.

And if you’re a total beginner in Sims 4 and you don’t know how to download and install mods, I’ll include a quick guide down below. But make sure to check my general Mods and CC guide for a detailed look into adding mods and custom content to the game.

You can find many mods over at ModTheSims, which hosts a wealth of community-made free mods for you to download and enjoy as you please. Installing mods is simple enough – all you need to do is drag the mod files over to the game’s mod folder. In a typical setup, this should be Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.
Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
For those of you who are tired of being bombarded with phone calls from sims you’ve never met, or don’t want to bother sharing your personal information with the world, here’s the mod for you. The Sims 4 is already a pretty realistic game, but with this mod, it will become even more realistic. Now your phone number will be private and only given out to people you want. It’s just like in real life! Download from this page.
And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?

Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
Say goodbye to generic, meaningless conversations and hello to meaningful, engaging chats with this mod for the Sims 4! As a fan of the Sims 4 who’s tired of seeing their storyless Sim friends chatting about nothing, this mod was made for you. You will be giving them some personality with this mod and never experience any more mundane conversations again. Install it from this page.
Better Build/Buy might be one of the slightly more involved mods to set up, but it’s worth the few extra steps. It makes building a lot easier, giving you access to hidden Sims 4 objects you’d normally have to work harder for or use a cheat to get. It comes loaded with other features as well, from expanding your build catalog from two rows to five, clone objects without restrictions, and find items easier thanks to their technical labels.

by LittleMsSam does many, many small mods that fix problems or improve things based on her own annoyances with the game. Let friends age up is a good example of this - it will make your Sims' friends age up all at once, which makes sense... and is also a matter of convenience. She has a lot of things to browse so I suggest you use her mods list and look around. There are many standalone mods, but also random small mods. You can also download all of her random small mods in one package and look through files to see what you'd like to keep or toss.
You just need to look at the game’s strong library of user generated content to see what’s really keeping the lights on. The Sims 4 mods scene is thriving, with plenty of weird and wonderful additions to the base game. We’ve compiled a list of what we think are the best Sims 4 mods accompanied with links to all the download pages. Be sure to read the install instructions for each mod.
