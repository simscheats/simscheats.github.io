## How to install a sims 4 mod that allows children to express their love for one another.

Just like real humans, sims also experience a wide variety of emotions and love is just one of them. Similar to adults, children sometimes develop a connection with each other that may turn into love as they grow old. Following on the same concept sims 4 first love mod was created by our talented modders.

This wholesome little mod by LITTLEMSAM’S comes with several interactions for your child and teen sims. And, we are in love with all of them! Every single interaction assists us in creating that dreamy childhood-friends-to-lovers storyline we are all pining for. We also want to remind you that everything is 10 times cuter when done by little child sims. Whether those interactions are walking, talking, hugging, stargazing, or whatever it may be, they just make it look cuter. Now, we know you are itching to get to know these new and adorable interactions… So, let us give you an overview of these cute first innocent love mod interactions:
Child dating mod is one of the most popular mods available. Till now, only teens or older couples could fall in love and have a special relationship with each other. But with child love mod , your child sims can also have crushes on the fellow sims, perform various activities with them, and fall in love as they grow up to become teens. Your sim will need to develop ‘relationship progress’ in order to turn their crush into love interests.
Download first love mod and your sim will also be able to experience the true essence of young love. If this doesn’t work properly then do check the local folder. Also, if you’re looking something more fiery for your adult sims then do check out the passionate romance cc.
With this mod by Sacrificial, which can be downloaded here, your Sims can enjoy a slow romantic dance together. Unlike in the regular game, Sims will put their arms around each other and gaze at each other, looking totally smitten. They can also be prompted to hug or have a little make-out session while dancing. While this is going on, they will get flirty moodlets, and their romance bar for the couple will increase.

However, we can likely all agree that yes, a first child love mod is not on the top of our priority list for the Sims 4. But, we cannot help but feel we need it once we found out it exists. Moreover, this childhood-friends-to-lovers storyline just will not leave us alone. Yes, we might not need it in our game… But oh my gosh do we want it! Having such a neat little kid mod in our game will just add that extra little bit of realism, and we are here for it! We are here for the cute wholesome first love storyline, and we know you are too! Therefore, it is our absolute pleasure to present this mod to you.
Sims have an option to “develop crush/love” on other sims of the same age group (teen-to-teen or adult/elder-to-adult/elder - no, I won’t be making a version for teen/adult), which will set the “crush”/”love” flag and also trigger the crush/love FX (sound effect, floating pink hearts above their head). It’s one-sided, so you can make an unrequited crush/love if you want. To have both the crush option and the love option you must have both “midgethetree_developcrush” (or midgethetree_developcrush_childenabled) and “midgethetree_developlove”; otherwise pick the package for the interaction you want.
Even though there are plenty of interactions for our adult sims when it comes to romance, the kids have sort of been overlooked. Much to our disappointment, since a wholesome childhood friends-to-lovers is one of our absolute favorite tropes. Now, let’s just imagine for a second… A childhood-friends-to-lovers storyline in the Sims 4. On an idyllic summer day, two little sims players meet at the park in Willow Creek and become fast friends… They spend the rest of the summer playing together, and soon they are best friends.
The interactions are perfectly innocent. If a child's friendship bar with another Sim gets full, they can reveal they have a crush and perform interactions such as hugging or stargazing together. After a while, the child can also ask the crush to be his boyfriend/girlfriend.

## How to create a custom relationship in a sims 4 mod.

My Set Family Relationships Mod allows you to set a target sim as your sim’s sibling, cousin, aunt, grandparent, etc., but because of the way the game is coded, the romance menu still appears. This mod removes the Romance Menu for all of the following relationship types :
Mc Command Center makes it so much easier to modify relationships in the sims 4 without having to type in long cheat codes. This mod also gives you the option to change the relationship settings in your sims 4 game. I’ll take you through some of its features.
You absolutely NEED this mod to make sims 4 relationship cheats the EASIEST they can possibly be. To explain what this mod does in simplest terms, instead of having to type cheats codes into the cheats bar, you can just click on things in the sims 4 UI (such as skills, needs, money, etc.) to alter them.
To use the mod, click on the desired sim and click on the Set Family Relationships Menu. Here, you can add or remove relationships (parents are not included because I couldn’t get the family tree to update the way MCC grandparents and siblings worked). For example, if you click on a sim, you can make them your active sim’s grandparent by clicking “Set as Grandparent”.
Once you’ve created your Sims in the Create a Sim tool, click on the diamond ‘Sim’ icon in the top-left. This will bring up the current selected Sim’s information panel. At the bottom right of the panel, you’ll see a button with a silouhette of two people on it. Click it, and that will bring up the ‘Edit Relationships’ window.
By default, any Sim you create (unless you go through the genetics tool) will be a ‘household member’. That’s essentially a neutral roommate – they’ll get on well enough, but they don’t have any particular bond yet. It’s handy if you want to shape the relationship yourself (or use a cheat to edit them!) but chances are, you’ll want to define if your Sims 4 household members are related in any way.
Wow! Some of those cheats are super long and quite complex. That’s why I just use mods to quickly and easily cheat my sims relationships. No more having to write out long cheat codes. With the click of a few buttons, I can alter my sim’s relationships. The mods I’m going to share with you are also listed in my must-have mods for sims 4 post because they are essential for playing the sims 4.
This all-in-one mod allows you to control just about everything from slowing your Sim's need decay to letting you have some control over non-player Sims. The MCCC mod has an additional package of mods designed explicitly for issues pertaining to woohoo.
