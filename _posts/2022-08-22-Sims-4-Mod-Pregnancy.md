## Sims 4 mod pregnancy: how to get pregnant in seconds

Pekesims fixes this issue by introducing the possibility of even more babies with this The Sims 4 pregnancy mod. Be warned, however, that raising this many children is going to be a major challenge, but at the same time, it really does make things a bit more interesting. For extreme family players only!

This is honestly such a quality-of-life addition to the game that I can’t imagine playing The Sims 4 otherwise. The fact that you can create your ideal pregnancy in Sims 4 is very fun, so definitely check the mod. It’s created by Java7nerd and you can find all of his cheatlines through the link below.
And for others, that's too short for those who want to cherish the experience of their Sims having a baby. Havem's Pregnancy Time mod lets you change how long your Sim is pregnant. You can choose to have it last as short as a day or as long as 147 days in-game!
A pregnancy in the regular The Sims 4 game goes by super fast. In fact, within three days, your Sim can expect to be in labor at the hospital or at home, with their newborn baby in a crib. If this feels too unrealistic or quick, there's a great fix provided by Havem's mod.
With the pregnant Sim as the active character, open the cheat console and enter: Sims.Add_Buff Buff_Pregnancy_Inlabor. (Note the American spelling of 'labor' if it's tripping you up.) This will immediately trigger the 'Pregnancy: In Labour' moodlet, allowing your Sim to have the baby.

When playing The Sims 4 you can often be really bored with how pregnancy works, your sims don’t suffer enough, they aren’t living it super realistically and it’s just annoying. Downloading even just one of these sims 4 pregnancy mods you can completely change how you see pregnancy and enjoy the game. Happy playing!
Something that just isn’t realistic in the game is that you have the option to woohoo or to try for baby but IRL you really don’t have the choice of trying for baby or woohooing as every single woohoo experience can result in pregnancy. With a mod like risky woohoo your sims are going to have the potential to get pregnant from just a regular woohoo.
Also yes, there are mods that allow male Sims to undergo pregnancy. There are way too many to tell which one is the best so just have a look in Google and pick your favorite from there. I’m just pointing this out in case you’re interested in installing one of those!
In The Sims 4, the player can have the prospective mother do a pregnancy test after trying for a baby. This is done by selecting the action at the toilet. If the Sim is pregnant, a "First Trimester" moodlet will appear, and will last 24 hours. If a pregnancy test is not done, the Sim will appear pregnant around 24 hours after conception.

## How to create a sims 4 modregnancy

Are you looking to torture yourself a bit more in The Sims 4 by having a ton of babies at once? Well, youneed this multiples mod. This mod is going to allow your sims to give birth to more than just triplets with quadruplets, quintuplets and even sextuplets being possible with this mod installed.
There's a surprising amount of restrictions when it comes to who can get pregnant in The Sims 4. While biologically it might make some sense, this is a game and players should be able to play out whatever scenarios they want. So, here, in the name of ultimate equality, is a mod that allows just about anyone to impregnate anyone!
Tearing up limitations in The Sims 4 is what I always aspire to do, so this mod is a natural fit for me. And if you find the other mods on this list too large or not needed but you’d still like to have the freedom to choose which Sim will get pregnant in your game, I’d say download and install this mod!
In fact, this mod is a large combination of many different mods, some of which we mentioned above. It serves as a go-to extension whenever you plan to start a new family in Sims 4. It really makes the whole pregnancy experience complete and real-life-like. The collection is done by a few brilliant creators at ModTheSims. And you can find more through the link below!
If you’re wanting to choose how many babies you want your sims to have you may want to download the choose number of babies mod for the game. You can choose a file to download from 1 to 3 babies so the default will change and you can choose how large you want your sim’s family to be.
Not all mods related to pregnancy for The Sims 4 are necessarily happy. However, they can still be useful when trying to make dramatic and extremely emotional stories in a game as happy-go-lucky as The Sims 4. The Pregnant Aging & Death mod by PolarBearSims does that job perfectly.
With the Babies for Everyone mod by Agonistagent, you essentially eliminate the boring limitation that only aged females can get pregnant in Sims 4. Instead, you open up the borders and allow everyone to be able to get pregnant. This includes male Sims, teen Sims, elder Sims, and more!
Next up on our list of sims 4 pregnancy mods is the baby maker trait which is hilarious! This trait’s description states “Babies, Babies, Babies! Can’t get enough of them. This sim wants lots of children. They are flirty very often and have many baby mamas or baby daddys to give them children. Commitment issues are possible if their significant other doesn’t give them enough children. Babies make the world go round!”
