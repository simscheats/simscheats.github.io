While being a minor skill, The Sims 4 Get Famous Media Production manages to make itself highly recommended for players building fame for their Sims. It doesn't have many levels to unlock, but it does integrate very well. Here's a guide to using it and abusing it to boost fame gains and add to your Sim's income.

by LittleMsSam does many, many small mods that fix problems or improve things based on her own annoyances with the game. Let friends age up is a good example of this - it will make your Sims' friends age up all at once, which makes sense... and is also a matter of convenience. She has a lot of things to browse so I suggest you use her mods list and look around. There are many standalone mods, but also random small mods. You can also download all of her random small mods in one package and look through files to see what you'd like to keep or toss.

You should never have to pay for any sims 4 mods ever, this includes custom content too. There are actually rules that come directly from EA that state that you are not allowed to have things behind permanent pay walls and are only allowed to have these items on early access on things like Patreon but you must eventually make these items available for free.
First, vlogs (Record Video menu). Making vlogs is pretty cool as there are gadget (tech review), beauty, and toy review categories as well as emotional blogs you can do. Sims can also study trends to see what is hot and use either the record menu or a drone to get footage of that. Trends last several days (pay attention to the message to know when trends will be ending).

## Evaluate your sims 4 mod to see if it is successful.

I’d definitely advise you to stay away from mods like Wonderful Whims if you’re below 18 years old. Some of the content you may counter could be dangerous and harmful, so keep that in mind. As much as we want to bring The Sims 4 closer to reality, sometimes it’s simply better not to do that.
Oh my goodness no! There has been modding for The Sims for the entirety of the franchise and EA does a great job of making sure that this is possible. Adding mods to your game is not going to get your banned from origin, you literally have nothing to worry about in that department!
Since sims 4 mods aren’t created by or maintained by EA there is always a chance that something in a mod can conflict with the way the game operates, especially since The Sims 4 is consistently updated. You want to find sims 4 mods that are consistently updated too because mods can break often, and can break your game if they aren’t updated.
Mods Must Be Enabled in the game options menu in order to work. Mods that are zipped may need extraction. See each mod's installation instructions for further info. You can organize your mods folder by using 1 level of subfolders beneath The Sims 4/Mods/ but no more. Script mods can only be read that deep, but if you like you can sort CC a bit deeper at 3-4 layers.
After the patch for The Sims 4: Seasons there were tons of really great cheats totally removed from the game, making it impossible for us to use them. Thankfully, Twisted Mexi (patreon) created a mod where you can turn these cheats back on. There is even an entire list of cheats so you know which ones you can use!
In The Sims 4 we are only given 3 slots for choosing traits for our sims which is a down grade from 5 in The Sims 3, which is disappointing. Thankfully, modders like Vicky Sims (patreon) create mods that you can use to add more traits which can help give your sims more personality.

Scumbumbo's Self-Configurable Autonomy Mod allows you to take extreme control over Sims' autonomy. This mod is actually now a part of Deaderpool's Master Controller, though you are able to use it standalone as well. You should not use this if you have MCCC. What it does is lets you block Sims from certain autonomous actions, so you can allow autonomy for certain things but customize what Sims will do with their free will. The best thing about this is that it keeps the text file it stores interactions in, so you can do this for every save game.
This auto shorter teens mod will remove at least one of those annoyances by changing the default height for all teens in your game. However, with any mod that alters the shape of a sim there are going to be multiple animation issues when playing, so just be aware of that.
