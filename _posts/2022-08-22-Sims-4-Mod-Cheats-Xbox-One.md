Sadly, again, the answer is a resounding no. You cannot get Sims 4 mods on Xbox One. In fact, both mods and custom content are not supported on the Xbox One, just like the PS4. While this may come as disappointing news to some fans, mod support on consoles for games in general tends to be rare.
The Sims 4 on Xbox One is a simulation game that puts you in charge of the daily lives of the titular sims. It's an offshoot of the massively popular Sim City series from Maxis, and it provides a similar type of sandbox gameplay. The game is different every time you play, and there are a ton of things to do and see, but Sims 4 cheats are the best way to get right into things.
Unfortunately, you cannot get Sims 4 mods on PS4. This is sadly one of the features that didn’t make the cut when the game was ported to console. This news was shared by Michael Duke, a Senior Producer on the game, who replied to a tweet regarding mod support for The Sims 4 on PS4 back in 2017.

## Modifications to the game can be made using cheat codes.

Cheats in The Sims 4 for Xbox One work by altering things about the game to make it easier, unlock items that are difficult or impossible to obtain, and generally make things more interesting and fun. When you enable cheats, you'll see a message indicating that all achievements will be turned off. That means you're free to use as many cheats as you want and have your fun, but you have to earn achievements the old fashioned way.
There are a few differences between entering cheat codes on a PC/Mac and entering them on a console like the PlayStation®4 or Xbox One. The most important, though, is that enabling some cheats on a console actually disables Achievements and Trophies on your current game save. You’ll need to earn those the old-fashioned way, without using cheats.
Some cheats that you’ve comfortably used in the past may simply not work today. The game gets updated regularly and new packs arrive all the time. So, the developers may sometimes remove a cheat or two if they think that it’s potentially harmful to the game. This was the case with the cheat to remove buffs, but the community found a solution around it!
Most of the cheats in The Sims 4 on Xbox One are activated by entering codes into the cheat console. The exceptions to this rule are interaction cheats, which are accessed through context menus. These cheats are all available as soon as you turn cheats on.
To use these cheats in the PC version of the game, you need to hold shift when you click on a sim or object to access the special cheat menu. Since that isn't possible on Xbox One, you have to press and hold the B button before pressing the A button to access this menu.
There are no risks associated with using Sims 4 cheats as long as you enter the cheat codes correctly. However, if you enter a cheat code incorrectly, it could cause your game to crash or malfunction. It is also important to note that some cheat codes can only be used once per game session.
One of the most important Sims 4 cheat codes to enter is testingcheats true, which enables additional cheats and allows you to shift-click on Sims, items etc to reveal further cheat options. To shift-click on consoles, press X+O (PS4) or A+B (XBO) at the same time.
And so, to enable cheats in The Sims 4, you must insert the “testingcheats true” or “testingcheats on” line in the dialogue bar. By pressing ENTER, you’ll receive a quick message informing you that codes are now enabled in your game. When that is done, you can proceed with adding the cheats that you want. Or you can SHIFT + CLICK on a Sim during your gameplay for some quick cheating.
