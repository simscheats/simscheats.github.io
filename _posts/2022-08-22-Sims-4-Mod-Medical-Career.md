## Create a career in the medicalsims 4 game.

The Sims 4's Doctor Career comes via the Get to WorkExpansion Pack and is one of the most challenging Careers I've ever covered. In this Career, you will start with janitorial duties, interruption of actual Doctors with socials, and patient relations and proceed to being able to run your own tests and diagnose patients. As you go forward, the Career gets more defined although menial tasks will still pop up as objectives. You will eventually be able to perform surgeries and deliver Sim Babies as you advance, while your Sim will also have a clearer picture of what is wrong with the patient as they progress. The Doctor's Career level determines success rate with many interactions. Try to take care of patients as much as possible, and do not misdiagnose them, for fear of losing job performance! This guide should help you with those things, as I have a list of symptoms of each illness, while I'll also share the Doctor's career schedule and rewards.

There are many medical careers that you can take in real life, but in The Sims 4 the only option we have is the doctor career. Why not let your sims have more specific medical careers? With this option for sims 4 career mods your sims are going to be able to become an anesthesiologist where they’ll be responsible for making sure that people stay asleep when getting surgery.
This medical career option reminds me of an older game style career where you start off as a resident and get to work your way up to be a fancy doctor. This career has a bunch of different paths you can take including cardiology, paediatrics, plastics and dermatology. Your sims are going to need to work on skills like charisma, fitness and even the parenting skillif you choose paediatrics.
The next option on our list of sims 4 career mods is the Orthotist and Prosthetist medical career. This is a one level career for your storytelling so you can give it to sims and just have them work this job for life. This is nice because you don’t have to work toward promotions and can just get your money and go home.
You will start as a Medical Intern but you can climb your way up to become the Chief of Staff. By leveling up in the Doctor career you will unlock clothing, objects and even a Trait: Sickness Resistance. What will you do as a Doctor? Flirt with your co-workers? deliver babies? or diagnose patients?

But as you’re working your way through the medical career in Sims 4, it isn’t even just about the active workday, or leveling up your skills. You’ll also need to contend with two issues: becoming ill yourself and making those house calls on your offer hours.
An altruistic streak has compelled you to join a Sim neighborhood clinic as a GP. The pay won't be high, but you'll help a lot of less fortunate Simcitizens through broken bones, pregnancies, and measles. You will be handling a lot yourself, but don't slack off on the skill-building--you may want a different job someday.
The doctor career in The Sims 4 is such a fun way to play because it makes you participate in every part of your sim’s lives. Working with your sim is such a great time and can make you feel more connected to your sim’s career. I really hope this article helped with your doctor career. Happy Playing!
When we got The Sims 4: Get to Work we were given 3 active careers for your sims to play. The doctor career is one of them where you can go to the hospital and treat patients and spend your sim’s day helping people. As you go through the levels of the doctor career you’ll unlock new CAS items, a brand new trait that will keep you healthy, and a ton of new abilities at the hospital.

## Find various medical objects and treatments in the game.

Treadmill and X-Ray testsFind these under the Medical Referral social menu. These can help to narrow down illnesses, but will have a high failure rate until you're level 7+ in the Career. Until then, try to avoid them or else make sure that your Sim is Focused. A visit to the computer to get a moodlet beforehand can really help with this. Sometimes, you DO have to run the test twice, as the game indicates. They can be super helpful once your Sim is qualified to analyze the results of both tests.
FYI the games matrix for determining aliments is a little glitchy. I've had patients with only two choices; no illness and bloaty head for example. And though they are obviously sick (spots, stripes, coughing etc.) it will give me a wrong diagnosis when choosing the one sickness choice I was given.
First you will need to diagnose your patient that come in to the hospital. You can use the X-Ray Machine, run tests, or bring the patient to the examination table to check his eyes, ears and take his temperature. Another option is to put your patient on the Treadmill to diagnose them.
The following set of images are courtesy of officialghosts on our Forum. Use this to help you narrow down illnesses, as I've used their list to help connect each symptom to a disease. If they have one of these symptoms, look up the illnesses above to see if they have other symptoms! You got this. The process of elimination is your friend.
Treating PatientsDiagnose an illness by selecting it when you're sure, and the treat option will come up. You'll know right after administering treatment whether it was a success or failure. Find this option on the social menu after you diagnose. Surgery only comes up with Triple Threat, Burnin' Belly, and when you need to deliver a baby at level 8 and up.
When you do not have a patient to analyze, look to the front desk. You can admit patients to the beds yourself, and will often be forced to. Calibrating the X-ray machine gives you a Focused moodlet. You'll sometimes need to do this in order to get a better X-ray of a patient - Calibrate then 'Refer to X-Ray Scan' on the patient, later found under the Medical Referral menu. Know that the X-ray machine can be upgraded to feature faster scanning and become unbreakable, so long as your Sim has the Handiness Skill. At level 8, you can also upgrade the Analysis machine to make it unbreakable.
Thank you for this! I failed diagnosing and treating two patients now. It was kind of difficult to diagnose when I didn't know what to look for. I only looked at the superficial signs such as rashes, steam coming out of their ears, and rubbing their belly. I never knew there were "idle" animations that would help me diagnose the patients. Thank you!
The Hospital is only accessible when you need to work at the Hospital. Join your Sim at their workday or manage your Sims at home. When working in the Hospital you can find rooms for patients, analyzing, performing surgery, a room with X-Ray Machines and a room for Medical Treadmills. These are the ones you will be using.
