## Sims 4 mod manager overview.

If you ask why, then you’re on the right track to make your life a lot easier. You see, the Mod Manager is a quality of life, fully developed software that helps you organize all The Sims 4 files. If you’ve ever found yourself in the mess of all the additional mods and CC you download for the game, then this is your ticket out of that hell!

Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
That’s everything you need to know about Sims 4 custom content. If you’re looking for general Sims 4 mods, we’ve got an excellent guide for that. We’ve also got a Sims 4 cheats list if you’re looking for some help running your sim’s lives. Failing that, why not read up on what we want from The Sims 5, should Maxis decide to give us another iteration.
The Mod & Custom Content Manager is described as a file explore with additional features which allows you to browse your files for The Sims 4 easily. You are able to delete and move files but also disable and enables files both on their own, in multiples or even whole folders. View files alongside thumbnails, which will help you distinguish content that is for Build Buy Mode or Create A Sim.

So, if your Sims 4 game is facing issues with these errors, the key is to opt for the Sims 4 cc organizer. With the help of this mod organizer, you can sort all your existing mods. In simple terms, it isn’t just a mod organizer, rather, it helps with proper installation, removal, fixing, as well as organizing of the Sims 4 mods.
modthesims.info - Definitely my go-to, though I don't use CC heavily. Everything on MTS is totally free, and it's exceptionally well-organized. This makes for an easy browsing experience. They feature so much content that they are almost all you need in order to really beef up your game with CC. Of course, modthesims also has plenty of mods, and many of the best mod makers in The Sims community are members there.

What we mean to say is that, we think that every simmer, a newbie or a veteran, will find a lot of uses for the Mod Manager. Its main strengths are that it makes everything super simple, quick and easy to control. After a few minutes of using it, you will become a master and you will know where every mod file of yours is, whether it’s turned on or off, whether you need it or not…

## How to install a sims 4 mod.

Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
And if you click on the furthermost tool in the same corner, the one labeled Open The Sims 4 “Mods” folder, you will be directed to the destination of your installed mod. Notice that if a mod isn’t checked/selected in the main list on the Mod Manger, then it won’t be shown in the folder either.
Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
Another factor that you need to keep in mind is that the system requirements might change depending on the updates provided for the mod. With the Sims 4 mod installer, you can ensure that all your mods are in sync with the system requirements. If there is a mod that isn’t in sync, it will be removed or sorted out.
Sims 4 players will need to manually enable any downloaded custom content and mods through the in-game menu. To do this, press ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.
With the previous versions of Sims 4 Mod Organizer or Manager, the installation of package mods first required you to extract “Package” files from somewhere & add them alongside the mod organizer. However, in the latest version of the TS4MM or The Sims 4 Mod Manager, this particular step has been removed. If the mods or package mods downloaded by you are contained inside the “.rar”, “.zip”, or “.7z” archive, one can simply drag the same into the manager and add the same with a button.
After you install the program, the main framework that you’ll be using in it is called Manage Mods. If you click on it, an empty page will open up. Since you have just now installed it for the first time, you will need to import all of your mods and CC. That’s easily done through the little plus “+” button at the bottom left corner. But be aware that sometimes the program links to your Sims 4 folder, and if you already have mods and CC loaded to the game, they might appear on the page.
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.
