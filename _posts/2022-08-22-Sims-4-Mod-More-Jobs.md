## Create more jobs for your sim in the sims 4 mod store.

With most things in The Sims 4 universe, you can fix this with the use of career or job mods that can be downloaded from various creators in the community. These jobs cover all sorts of ways of life including things like cosmetology, nursing, and social services and these can really help you create more interesting characters.

And one last thing, (I know this intro is getting longðŸ˜…) if you want to make the base game sims 4 active careers more fun, I highly recommend downloading the Get to Work Aspirations Mod which you can find linked in my 36+ Sims 4 Custom Aspirations post (itâ€™s #32 on the list!)
We know how sometimes it feels a bit frustrating when the career and job options in The Sims 4 are limited. Good thing tons of awesome job and career mods are easily available for download â€“ thanks to the creative minds of mod creators! If youâ€™re on the hunt for the best Sims 4 job and career mods, weâ€™ve got some good news! This article puts together the best one weâ€™ve found across several sources. Check them out below!
Below you are going to find over 40 downloadable custom careers that you can add to your game to give to your sims. These are all rabbit hole careers so they are going to function similarly to careers like business or athletic that are already in the game.
With these The Sims 4 career cheats you can get yourself that automatic promotion without any of the effort. They literally take the work out of work. Simply enter careers.promote in your cheat console followed by the name of the career you want to advance your Sim in and voila (make sure you have started this career first though). Each time you use these cheats, youâ€™ll advance a level so you might even fancy repeating this cheat until you reach the top of the ladder.

Once youâ€™ve enabled Sim 4 career cheats with the instructions above, make sure youâ€™ve clicked on the Sim you want to level up. You can also use the cheats below and replace promote with demote, if you want to take your Sim down a few pegs. Once youâ€™ve enabled cheats, you must type testingCheats true into the console and then use any of the relevant cheats below.
There really arenâ€™t many jobs in The Sims 4, especially if you only have the base game and this can lead to not having a lot of options for storytelling. We get the basics like a business career and an athletic career, but to get anything more interesting youâ€™re going to need to own some DLC.
A new mod has been created for the game The Sims 4 that will allow your sim to have their own Youtube channel. Your sim can upload videos of themselves playing games, DIY or makeup tutorials, and more. They can also update their channel with blog posts, vlogs, and live streams to keep up their gamer, DIY, or MUA cred on top of having a full-time job. Another cool thing about this mod is that it will let your sim go vlogging and make videos of their everyday life. To take your Sim down this career path, know that they will struggle. So, you need to have some patience. Check it out on this page.
Iâ€™m pretty sure youâ€™re not the only one wishing for more career options for your Sims. Sure, there are a lot of careers included in the base game, but this mod has more options that have been missed by the developers. With four new career paths for firefighters, hotel employees, stylists, and private tutors to the game, the mod package makes a great addition for fans of a larger variety of career paths. These mods, published by sims-blog.de, have more than 300,000 downloads to date at ModTheSims, making them one of the most popular mods in the community. To download the modifications, just go to this page.

## Find and install mods for the sims 4.

By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
Go to your Mods folder and right-click it. Again, copy it to your Desktop. Once you're sure you have a copy of your Mods folder on your Desktop, go ahead and delete the copy in your Sims 4 folder. Restart your game and play it for a few minutes. If your game runs without crashing or having errors, you know the issue is with one of your Mods. If it doesn't, you'll need to go out and repair your game (and the issue is something within your Sims 4 game itself).
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
That's the basics on how to install mods and custom content for The Sims 4, as well as how to troubleshoot, uninstall and keep your Mods folder organised! Got any questions or suggestions that I haven't covered above? Feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to help!
Identifying the problematic mod can be as easy as deleting the last mod you've downloaded, if the problem cropped up after that. Paste your Mods folder back into your Sims 4 folder and then sort your files by Date Modified. Delete the most recent mod/CC and restart your game, play for a few minutes and see if your game works. If so, you've found the problem mod.
Remember that game mods and custom content are designed to work with genuine versions of The Sims 4. There is no guarantee that they will work with pirated versions of the game, so if you do have a pirated version and a mod isn't working, that could be why. The only way to fix this would be to buy a copy of The Sims 4 directly from Origin, where you can ensure the game will be patched regularly and compatible with all mods and custom content.
Check that the mod itself is up-to-date. With the Sims 4, nearly every time a patch comes out, it breaks a variety of mods. Usually, the mod's creator will be aware of this and will update their website to notify players of this. Check the page you downloaded the mod from and then delete and reinstall the new version, if necessary. Sims websites like SimsVIP also keep a running tab of incompatible mods and CC after patches.
Open up the folder and check the contents inside. Usually, you'll just see files that end with .package. This is the file-type used for Sims 4 mods and custom content. You might see some other file types too. Some creators include images of their CC or .txt ("read me") files. These can be safely discarded. If you see file types ending in .ts4script, .bpi, .blueprint or .trayitemâ€”these are also Sims 4 file types, and I'll tell you how to install those below. Do not delete them!
