When it comes to searching for the best Sims 4 mods in 2022, one must not miss out on the Color Sliders mod. I thought this was not possible for the longest time. I mean, there were tons and tons of blogs talking about it but there was no actual representation of the idea until Thepancake1 and MizoreYukii took the initiative.
Say goodbye to generic, meaningless conversations and hello to meaningful, engaging chats with this mod for the Sims 4! As a fan of the Sims 4 who’s tired of seeing their storyless Sim friends chatting about nothing, this mod was made for you. You will be giving them some personality with this mod and never experience any more mundane conversations again. Install it from this page.
With this mod, your Sims kids will stop being pushovers and actually become a bit more dangerous. They will turn into demonic toddlers the second you let your guard down. This mod makes life in the Sims 4 a lot more exciting. You can’t control them, but you can protect yourself. They will now be able to set things on fire, pick up deadly weapons and use them to attack anyone they see. Check it out here.
These changes don't just apply to adults, either. You'll notice that toddlers, cats and dogs also have more personality when this mod is installed, making the overall experience of The Sims 4 a lot more varied and interesting, especially when you're not in build mode.

With the mod installed, you'll see a lot more options and choices at every stage of the child-rearing process in The Sims 4. For example, when you're talking about your Sim's infant, you'll have a lot more conversational topics to choose from. And when you interact with the bassinette, your options there will be enhanced as well.
Even if you don’t intervene, the mod allows the sims to explore randomly. While the mod works with the base game, some activities won’t work if you don’t have the specific packs. For instance, you must have the cool kitchen stuff pack to send your sims out for ice-cream.
Sims 4 has come a long way in improving certain aspects of the game that had long been forgotten by its predecessors. One of such features is the overhauled personality system. Despite the massive improvements, you will still find yourself wanting to make further improvements to the system. That is where this excellent mod comes in.
With love comes a lot of drama and for the amount of love that Sims 4 is dishing out, there doesn’t seem to be enough drama. Say no more! With this mod, you can add some controversy to every neighbourhood. You have a total of 11 dramatic scenarios for town NPCs and you can intervene in some of the interactions.

This step might be intimidating if you’ve never installed sims 4 mods before. One of the biggest reasons we hesitated from installing mods was because it seemed complicated. However, it’s straightforward and no harder than simply locating the correct folder.
You can find many mods over at ModTheSims, which hosts a wealth of community-made free mods for you to download and enjoy as you please. Installing mods is simple enough – all you need to do is drag the mod files over to the game’s mod folder. In a typical setup, this should be Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.

However, this mod allows you to recruit a roommate via the “LMS Roommates Service” on your phone or PC. You can filter different Sims and choose the one you really like to be your roommate. Your roommates are real people and have jobs/school, so they won’t be sitting home all day long and bother you.
Move the unzipped files to the mods folder. This will typically be in folder in “[DRIVE LETTER]:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.” (Replace your own Windows user name and the letter for your hard drive. ) If the “Mods” folder doesn’t exist, you can make your own, as long as it’s in the same location.
Downloaded Lots and Sims can be found by heading to the Gallery and going to ‘My Library’. Remember to tick ‘Include custom content’ from the left hand menu, as this will be unticked by default and will prevent you from viewing anything you have downloaded.

## Sims 4 mod packs 2022: what to bring

Are you wondering which mods are best for Sims 4? Would you like to know where to download the best sims 4 mods in 2022? Then you’ve come to the right place! We have compiled a list with the best mods and the corresponding download pages for The Sims 4!
And if you’re a total beginner in Sims 4 and you don’t know how to download and install mods, I’ll include a quick guide down below. But make sure to check my general Mods and CC guide for a detailed look into adding mods and custom content to the game.
To help you navigate what's on offer, here’s a lineup of the best Sims 4 mods, from the little tweaks, to the digital life-changers. Make sure to read the installation section, and double check for any conflicts to make sure you’re not running two that will butt heads.
And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?
Slice of Life not only does this, but with packs such as ‘My Phone Pack’, ‘My Health Pack’, and ‘My Beauty Pack’ which adds elements such as a makeup skill and wearable perfume or cologne, this free mod truly takes The Sims 4 to the ultimate next level.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
That’s everything you need to know about Sims 4 custom content. If you’re looking for general Sims 4 mods, we’ve got an excellent guide for that. We’ve also got a Sims 4 cheats list if you’re looking for some help running your sim’s lives. Failing that, why not read up on what we want from The Sims 5, should Maxis decide to give us another iteration.
A mod pack containing some of prolific Sims 4 modder roBurky's best work, all aimed at making your Sims feel more human. If you've used Emotional Inertia or True Happiness—both previously on this list individually—then you'll attest to the quality of roBurky's work, and both of those mods are in the package alongside other must-haves.
