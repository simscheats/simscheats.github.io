## Create a mod for the sims 4 game.

You thought we were done with The Sims 4 Werewolves? We’ve collected a list of werewolves mods that the community has created since the launch of The Sims 4 Werewolves! Make sure to read any pack or other requirements before installing. Now drink up some Moonpetal Punch and eat some raw meat while reading this list of werewolf mods.

The mod makes its original werewolves into a separate lifestyle called Lycans and brings a lot of different interactions between Lycans and Werewolves. Werewolves can join Lycan packs or invite Lycans to theirs. Players can create Lycan/Werewolf hybrids, and many of the perks that were made for Lycans from the mod can be obtained by werewolves too. The Werewolves Mod does not require The Sims 4 Werewolves game pack either, so players who don't have it can still enjoy werewolves in The Sims 4.
With a new heightened ability to smell, this Sim can put their nose to the ground and smell emotions on other Sims, sniff out treasure buried in the backyard, or detect nearby occult Sims. Some things smell better than others, so get out there and sniff!
Advanced Wererabies: A Tense moodlet that allows your still-frothing Sim to attempt to click a piece of workout equipment to "Sweat Out Infection". Neglecting to sweat it out or purchase a Cure For Lycanthropy from The Bar will result in your Sim progressing to the third stage.

## Create a custom sim who is a werewolf.

The simplest way to become a werewolf is to create one in the Create A Sim menu. To do this, simply click on the "Add Occult" button when you hover over the Add Family Member icon in Create A Sim, and then click "Add Werewolf" at the bottom of the occult menu. Now you can customise your wolf form as you wish by painting your fur, giving yourself some cool piercings, and customising your outfits at leisure.

The easiest way to get yourself a werewolf Sim is to make one in Create-A-Sim. This is fairly straightforward and works like creating any other occult type in The Sims 4. Just go into CAS and, from the panel at the bottom of the screen, select Add a Sim Add Occult Sim Add Werewolf. Just keep in mind that, in TS4, you can't change a character's life state once you begin creating them, and the default new character in CAS will always be a vanilla human; so you'll need to manually create another new character and specify them as a werewolf before you can begin. You can then either bin the default human Sim or make them your werewolf's roommate, whichever suits you.
Of course, this is The Sims, where you almost never have to do things the hard way if there's a cheat available instead. To instantly transform your vanilla human Sim into a werewolf, first make sure you've selected them as the active character in Live mode. Enable cheats and then type traits.equip_trait trait_occultwerewolf into the text bar for instant lycanthropification.
Make sure to become good friends with the Sims you want to turn into werewolves. Use Friendly interactions and awake their curiosity about being a werewolf. They’ll ask you to give them the Cursed Bite so that they can experience the werewolf lifestyle themselves.
Just be aware that you'll probably want to spend ages in Create-A-Sim when it comes time to make a new werewolf. By my estimation, werewolves have more customisation options than any other character type in The Sims 4: be they regular Sim, animal, or occult type. Basically, Create-A-Sim for werewolves includes full customisation of a human Sim form and an occult-exclusive Beast Form, and that Beast Form can itself be fully customised with coat marking options cribbed from the Cats & Dogs expansion. There's a lot to be on with.
Werewolves can be made in Create a Sim just like other occults. Werewolves can be chosen to have a multitude of presets, fangs, faces, ears, claws, etc. as well as wear normal Sim clothes if they wish. Werewolf pelts are also fully customisable similar to the Cats & Dogs expansion in which players can give them or draw on different colors and patterns.
A Sim in Werewolf form appears as an anthropomorphic wolf, having a wolf head and completely covered in fur. The werewolf form differs in appearance due to the extent of customization available in Create a Sim; having many different ears, faces, fangs, scars, teeth, claws, etc. available for selection, as well as many colors and patterns for their fur, and even the ability to customize the pelt with a paint system.
Buy a ‘Special Treasure Map’ for 2,415 simoleons, and then put it up on a wall. Click on the map and select the ‘Inspect the map’ option. Your Sim will start observing it for a few minutes, after which, he or she will get a moodlet called ‘A treasure huh?’ This Focused moodlet will last for 4 hours. During this moodlet, you’ll get an option called ‘Explore the deep dark woods’. Click that option, and your Sim will disappear in the woods for 3 hours. As soon as he or she returns, the first stage of werewolf transformation will begin.
