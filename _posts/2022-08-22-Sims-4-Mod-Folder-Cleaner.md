## Sims 4 mod folder cleaner is a tool to help you clean your mods folder.

This will open the Mods folder and automatically highlight the file you selected in Sims 4 Tray Importer. Just right-click the file and delete it. The Sims 4 Tray Importer will automatically delete the files in your Mods folder for you, but only if you downloaded the separated .package file instead of the merged file. If you downloaded the merged .package file, all of the mods will be deleted.

The Sims 4 Mod Conflict Detector is a powerful tool based on GUI which is used for detection & solving the mod conflicts found in this game. This program allows the gamers to remove the trouble-making Sims 4 mods, technically failing mods, empty mods, and so on.
The Tray Importer is software for Sims 4 that helps you manage your CC. It actually allows you to download and upload CC and mods directly through it, which is awesome. But, it also shows you which CC files are broken/missing when you’re going over all of your CC and Mods. Then, you can either delete the broken files or find the missing pieces on the internet (it tells you the name of the missing CC files too).
If you are trying to decode how the Sims 4 broken mods finder works, you need to understand how they affect the game. When there is a broken custom content, you need to repair the same or clean the same as opposed to quitting and restarting the game. Doing the latter would lead to the game get corrupted with regular restarts. So, the best way to do this would be to use the Sims 4 find broken cc or Sims 4 cc cleaner. To get the best repair & changing services for your mods, you need to download the Sims 4 cc finder for broken mods.
What are ModsMods are game modifications to the Sims 4, pure and simple. Practically any game that is moddable has mods. They may enhance a feature, or introduce entirely new features. Mod creators work hard to make sure their content is stable and adds the functionality that is described when they share it with the Sims community. Some mods greatly enhance gameplay, make minor adjustments to how things work (like how often objects break), or simply fix something that irritates a lot of players. Mod creators sometimes fix bugs before EA does, and may at times be more in tune with the community's desires for how something should work. For example, door locks were released in a patch, but first came in the form of a mod.

To delete CAS items like hair, clothes, etc., launch The Sims 4, and select “Create A New Household.” Filter your custom content, and choose the items you want to delete from your Mods folder, including any broken mods in your game. To make this super easy, make sure to only dress your Sim in items that you want to delete.
An alternative method to The Sims 4 Tray Importer is the Sims 4 Studio. This tool will upload all custom content that you’ve downloaded and will allow you to preview items and delete them. First, download the Sims 4 Studio, then follow the instructions.
The Sims 4 has many unofficial mods and Custom Content that you can install to expand upon or improve gameplay, such as texture mods, new hairstyles and eye colors, custom houses, and more. This page teaches you everything you need to know about How to Install Mods in TS4 and where to find CC on PC and Mac.
Let’s say you have downloaded a ton of Build/Buy custom content and you’ve decided you no longer want it in your game, but you just can’t seem to figure out what the file is called in your mods folder. With the use of a few free tools from the modding community, we can easily locate and delete these mods.

## Sims 4 mod folder cleaner helps you keep your mods organized.

If your mods are not functioning properly in Sims 4, there are some free tools created by the modding community that will help you find and delete the files. The process can be tedious, but the best way is using Sims 4 Studio (a free tool for making custom content) and Sims 4 Tray Importer.
Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.
There are a few ways to clean up your Sims 4 folder. You can use the “Sims 4 Cleanup Tool” found here: https://www.thesimsresource.com/downloads/details/5691110-sims-4-cleanup-tool/. You can also delete any unused files in the “Assets” folder, and delete the “S4_Data” folder if you want to completely reset your game.
Before beginning the tidying up process, copy and paste your entire Sims 4 folder somewhere safe. My suggestion is a thumb drive dedicated strictly for Sims. Get the largest you can afford. A quick search of Amazon shows that a 128gig flash drive can be purchased for under $35 USD. Try to get an even bigger one, if you can. You should already be doing this on a regular basis of your important folders. These include your saves, tray, screenshots, and mods folders. Backing up ensures that you will not have a catastrophic loss of your important Sim documents later.
I wanted to talk to you about organizing your Sims 4 folders. I’m one of those people who likes everything nice and tidy, including my Sims 4 folders. So, I wanted to show you how I organize my folder. This will be done in multiple articles with the first one covering the mods folder.
A quick little side note: It is important to organize your mods folder because if you are like me, you have over a thousand packages. If you are like many of my Simming friends, you have thousands of packages. Now imagine if there is a repeat of the “Day the Mods and Custom Content All Broke”. Remember that day? Remember the nightmare it was to figure out what broke? By having your mods folder organized, it facilitates the trouble shooting process. Instead of hunting and pecking and hoping you found it? You simply remove a few folders at a time, testing your game, till you no longer have their error. It’s that simple.
Got that renaming out of the way? Let’s take a look at your mods folder. I’m going to ask you to copy your mods folder to your desktop and then delete everything in it. Trust me. You’ve already backed up your entire Sims 4 folder and for extra measure, you’ve now backed up your mods folder. Double backup, no need to panic.
Next, launch The Sims 4. Now ask yourself, “What mods do I want to discard?” To figure out which mods you want to keep from these packs, find an empty lot on the world menu and select “Build.” It can be any empty lot. Once loaded into your empty lot, start placing the custom content onto the lot.
