## Sims 4 mod carry baby allows players to carry around a baby sim in their inventory, which can be used to fulfill certain objectives or to pass time.

If you’re not on console (unfortunately, custom content is not yet available for console Sims 4 players), and you have enough storage, Sims 4 baby cc can add more customization, both from an aesthetic perspective, and even more, interactions to upgrade babies more to feeling like actual sims– whether or not the team chooses to update them.

They become a favorite of your family and end up attracting a lot of responsibility, which many players find hard to cope with. So to assist you in completing these tasks, we have laid some of the best sims 4 baby mods to help you enrich your gaming experience.
If you don’t download anything else, I highly recommend this as the best baby mod for Sims 4. This mod goes above and beyond another baby cc, in that it really does add realism and gameplay for sims taking care of a baby. As a family player, I like how it makes Sims 4 babies more interactive. Do note that you cannot use this mod with any mod that alters the base game bassinets– but it is base game compatible. I will note that the bulk of this mod is related to being a parent.
If you’re trying the 100 baby challenge– or just find your sims with a full household– taking care of a baby can be a challenge. And while technically during something like the 100 baby challenge you aren’t ‘supposed to use mods, there’s no judgment from me if you do. While I personally enjoy challenges in my Sims 4 game, I could also see this mod as being handy if you’re trying to do a machinima, let’s play, or simply want to focus on other sims.
The Baby Showers mod ties together with the Ultrasound mod, which allows the sim to reveal the gender and celebrate the soon-to-be baby with the pregnant Sim’s closest friends. This is just like any other event in the base game with the typical tasks you need to complete to get a reward. There are also a few additional decorations and interactive items that unlock with this mod as well.

Sims can also have babies in The Sims FreePlayafter the Two and A Half Sims quest. Babies can be gained by placing a crib (bought from the home store or children’s store) in a household where two adult Sims live.[n The player must then click on the baby icon above the cot. If the icon is grey then a baby cannot be attained because either the player has reached their current Sim limit or there are already four Sims living in that household. If the icon is blue, then a baby can be bought with a number of Simoleons and it will appear in the cot after a day. The player can also choose to go through a pregnancy journey, like main Sims games, with rewards, after the pregnancy store is built. At this point, the baby's gender, clothing, and eye and skin color can be selected. Players may choose whether or not to have the baby look like its parents.
Babies play a big role in Sims 4. They’re the center of every family in the game and you often spend much of your time and energy on them. But what if you can improve your overall experience? Well, that’s totally possible with the best baby mods and CC for Sims 4!
The new baby will now show up in the Simtracker and can be selected. This means that the player can see the baby's needs and get other Sims to interact with and care for the baby. Babies can only leave their crib if a teen Sim or older is tending to their needs, and as of level 10, adult Sims can carry them, place them on the ground and teach them to walk after doing the Nanny Knows Best quest. Babies are very easy to look after and can be sent to sleep manually any time they are in their cot. Unlike other games, babies can be left home alone. If the baby's needs get too low, it will start to cry and scream. Babies also cry if they want an adult to pick them up.
