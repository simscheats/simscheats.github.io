## Mod installation order for sims 4.

By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).

Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
Remember that game mods and custom content are designed to work with genuine versions of The Sims 4. There is no guarantee that they will work with pirated versions of the game, so if you do have a pirated version and a mod isn't working, that could be why. The only way to fix this would be to buy a copy of The Sims 4 directly from Origin, where you can ensure the game will be patched regularly and compatible with all mods and custom content.
or instead you can copy your mods folder to your desk top to make a copy and then delete the mods folder that is in your Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4. Do not delete the copy you put on your desktop or you will lose all of your mods and custom content.
Check that the mod itself is up-to-date. With the Sims 4, nearly every time a patch comes out, it breaks a variety of mods. Usually, the mod's creator will be aware of this and will update their website to notify players of this. Check the page you downloaded the mod from and then delete and reinstall the new version, if necessary. Sims websites like SimsVIP also keep a running tab of incompatible mods and CC after patches.

That's the basics on how to install mods and custom content for The Sims 4, as well as how to troubleshoot, uninstall and keep your Mods folder organised! Got any questions or suggestions that I haven't covered above? Feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to help!
To discover the load order file, it must be placed anywhere inside The Sims 4's mod folder. Additionally, the load order file's name must contain 'NeonOcean-Load-Order' and the file's extension should be '.json'. The load order file's name and file extension are not case sensitive.
Identifying the problematic mod can be as easy as deleting the last mod you've downloaded, if the problem cropped up after that. Paste your Mods folder back into your Sims 4 folder and then sort your files by Date Modified. Delete the most recent mod/CC and restart your game, play for a few minutes and see if your game works. If so, you've found the problem mod.
Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.

## Sims 4 mod installation order.

Make sure you are connected to the internet, then open Origin, go to The Sims 4 in your Game Library, click on the Settings tab, and then click on the Update Game button. If your game does need any updates, Origin will automatically download and install them. If your game is already fully updated, you'll get a notification telling you so.
This method is a bit risky, and one I only recommend to experienced modders of The Sims. Merging files really can speed up your loading time, but it can also cause issues, as there's no way to "un-merge" files once you merge them, and if one of the files breaks within your merged file, you'll have to delete everything merged with it to get rid of the problematic file.
Question: Every time I try to download a custom content clothing it always says I need a new version for my PC and go to the software and publisher to find out what version I need and I do not know how to do that. How do I get the right version of the Sims 4?
Obey the Rule of One. Mods do not merge on runtime. That is why load order is so important: Whatever is below is going to override what is above. Some mods simply will not work if another mod is blocking what a mod needs to run. Mods that alter or rebuild precombines will not work with others that also rebuild them.
Yeah it can be hard to sort. I would suggest keeping the pictures that comes with some of the hair and name them the same, then you can easily see what's what. Or download SimStudio in there you can open up the hair and see how it looks and then delete it from there.
Hi Adrian, thank you for letting me know about that! Sadly a lot of sites have plagiarised my work (I can see they even used my same screenshot of my Sims 4 folder, lol). I'll send them a copyright infringement letter straight away. Thanks for the head's up! :)
I have windows and I have no clue how to download stuff from the Sims Resource. it is really annoying me, I have tried absolutely everything and I have been trying for about 3 weeks. today I have already sat here for 4 hours please help I am being driven to insanity!!!! :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(
If you've tried all the troubleshooting methods and the mod/custom content still won't work, the best thing to do is contact the original creator and let them know. Give them a detailed example of what's happening in the game (i.e. "Whenever I place down the couch I downloaded, an error message comes up and says 'script call failed'"). Hopefully, they'll get back to you with an updated version of the content or a way to work around the error. If not, you may just need to uninstall the file from your game.
