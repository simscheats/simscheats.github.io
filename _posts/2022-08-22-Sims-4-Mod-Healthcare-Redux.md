I have recently been using the private practice mod but figured this was too much for a family to handle, they all got sick all the time. I heard about the healthcare redux mod and I looked into it. I have been trying to install it but it just doesn't work! The Patreon website tells me to download some files but nothing more and it just doesn't come into my game. Can someone who has the mod help me w this?

NOTE: There is a 40% chance Adults and Elder will be vaccinated already (based on the idea they were vaccinated as children) and a 20% chance Toddlers-Young Adults were already vaccinated. I want Sims to have diseases, even ones that are contagious, but spreading their diseases isn’t that important to me. If it’s important to you, other mods have much higher levels of contagion and non-playable sims will get sick much more often than will happen in this mod. Also, NPC like the mailman should be immune to all diseases. I didn’t need the mailman catching or spreading tuberculosis…
There are two flavors of this new mod, one mod stops ALL Sims from using their phones constantly while doing other tasks while the other flavor stops all EXCEPT teen Sims from constantly using their phones. Both flavors have the added feature of stopping your Sims from randomly changing the color of their phones no matter what age group they’re in.

GAME-RATED CONTENT ONLY
Mods that breaks the T-for-Teen game rating CANNOT be named or discussed in these official Sims forums. It’s against Forum Rules. Some creators of these mods also won’t be reported here depending on how sending you to their content works. Please see creators’ own social media.
Hospital is a special lot assignment in The Sims 4: Get to Work, accessible for Sims working in the doctor career and for pregnant Sims who are going into labor (with up to one companion). There is only one hospital in the game, which is located in the Civic Center sub-neighborhood. The lot assignment can't be given to other lots without mods, so they are not available anywhere else.
All CC beds, including separated beds but not Toddler beds, are very broken with the new pack. This is caused by new functionality (pillow fights, for example). It does not appear to apply if you don't have the pack installed. They can be updated by a batch fix is in Sims 4 Studio. CC that is a recolor of a game bed that relies the game file (such as beds by ReiAnn) are not broken by the pack. If modders let me know about those, I can clear them.
Oh, and UI cheats extension normally breaks after every patch. The creator is usually very fast at fixing it. In the meantime, either start a new save with the mods turned off or you can test to see if your mods/cc are broken (ideally also in a new save, so your Sims aren't affected).

## Sims can now visit doctors, heal in hospitals, and even research new medical treatments.

A menu on the Sim’s phone is available for all sims child and up called Healthcare Services. This is the hub for all available healthcare services. Your sims can make an appointment, attend an appointment at any time after making one, go to therapy, go to the hospital, get vaccinated, or go to the acupuncturist. Toddlers can only attend appointments by clicking on the toddler themselves! Once sims have booked a doctor’s appointment, they also have the option to schedule a time on the calendar to attend the appointment in the future. When it’s time for the appointment event to start, send the sim to the doctor appointment as usual.
Pregnancy Related Healthcare: Prenatal Visits, Pregnancy-Related Complication/Conditions (Preeclampsia, Pregnancy Related Anemia, and Gestational Diabetes), and Prenatal Vitamins to help with fetal development (and unrealistically reduces the chance of complications). Your sim, if they have a pregnancy complication, have increased risk of labor induction and/or c-section. All new parent sims have the chance to experience the baby blues which in some cases can lead to postpartum depression.
It was in Montgomery that Sims built his reputation among rich, white plantation owners by treating their enslaved workers. According to Vanessa Gamble, university professor of medical humanities at George Washington University, Sims’s practice was deeply rooted in the trade for enslaved people. Sims built an eight-person hospital in the heart of the trading district in Montgomery. While most healthcare took place on the plantations, some stubborn cases were brought to physicians like Sims, who patched up enslaved workers so they could produce—and reproduce—for their masters again. Otherwise, they were useless to their owners.
SICK VISIT APPOINTMENT: Before this update, you were unable to go to the doctor to get a diagnosis for your Sim's Sickness. Now, if the illness is something that is pushed by this mod, your Sim can get a diagnosis of what ails them as well as get medication to cure it.
Preventative Care: Toddler, Children, Teen, and Adult Vitamins to help supplement lifestyles and keep sickness at bay. Prenatal vitamins will help with fetal development (the mother will get positive moodlets) and again unrealistically reduce the chance of complications. Sims can schedule well-visits to make sure everything’s on track.
Sims can buy over the counter pharmaceuticals on the computer under the Purchase Pharmaceuticals option on the Healthcare Services menu. Your sim can also fill any prescriptions by using the online pharmacy under the Healthcare Services menu. A prescription from the doctor is required in order for this option to appear!
Every Sim employed is automatically opted into insurance. This gives them discounted rates on all healthcare services. If your sim loses their job or quits, they have 36 sim hours to get a new one before their healthcare runs out. The healthcare of the new job will take precedence. Medicare is available for all Elders who are not employed. Medicaid is available for children and toddlers who are not under the insurance of an adult. Anyone who does not have a job will be Uninsured which will result in much higher healthcare services costs.
Like most doctors in the 19th century, Sims originally had little interest in treating female patients—and no specific gynecological training. Indeed, examining and treating female organs was widely considered offensive and unsavory. But his interest in treating women changed when he was asked to help a patient who had fallen off a horse and was suffering from pelvic and back pain.
Credited as the “father of modern gynecology,” Sims developed pioneering tools and surgical techniques related to women’s reproductive health. In 1876, he was named president of the American Medical Association, and in 1880, he became president of the American Gynecological Society, an organization he helped found. The 19th-century physician has been lionized with a half-dozen statues around the country.

## The mod is in development for pc and mac, and is free to download.

This mod was made intentionally as an alternative solution for my own gameplay to using SOL (waiting for it to be modular) and Private Practice (I’m too lazy and I want my lots for my own things). This is to say that this mod was never initially meant to integrate with these systems.
This mod is a band-aid not a "proper fix": it simply helps you find the CC that you need to fix/remove and allows you to save your game. Note that the "groundhog day" bug is very likely caused by more than one underlying issue. This band-aid may help with it, but it may not fix the problem for all users as there may be something else going on that needs to be addressed.
While working on a related mod I realized that the High School Years hanging clothes, while marked as dressers, are missing the tuning that would make them actually function. So you click on them and nothing happens. So I figured, hey that's an easy fix that I can put out! Hopefully this is only a temporary fix until it gets patched but it should do the job for now. And when a real fix comes through I'll just discontinue this mod.
This is a new error that started occurring after the High School Years (1.90) game patch. At the moment it is not clear whether or not this is mod-related in origin or not, though personally I am leaning towards it being from a mod. Unfortunately, once the error occurs, it bakes itself into the save, and so removing mods alone will not fix it.
Also not listed: Mods/CC by people who copy other people’s mods/CC, copy other companies’ copyrighted content or trademarks, pirate software or openly support software piracy, do not release free public updates within a reasonable time (3 weeks for CC), or are otherwise not in compliance with EA's policy on mods.
thanks. I did. DO I have to get rid of all my CC? I troubleshooted myself and disabled first Scripted Mods (UI cheats) and all other Mods (Mods is where CC is, right?) and the game looked normal. Then I went back and just disabled Mods (CC), same issue and the same with UI cheats.
This topic is for collecting reports on mod and custom content status after the July 26, 2022, Sexual Orientation/High School etc. patch and the August 2 hotfix patch. Most mod updates are reported here; updates that only add a translation and non-broken CC updates generally aren't.
Townie Sexual Orientation: Fix & Diversity (flauschtrud) - The three versions of the mod vary in whether they make new townies all pansexual or with a variety of orientations. Please read the full description of the three versions - don't install all three
