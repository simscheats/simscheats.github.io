The Sims 4 is a widely loved game for a good reason: it lets players live out their dream lives in a dream world. After twenty years of successfully keeping the franchise alive, it's no wonder that recent rumors and news of EA potentially working on a brand new installment has excited every Simmer on the surface of the planet.
Players must then place their Sim in front of the green screen, and select another Sim to either take a photo from a camera in their Inventory, or place a camera on a tripod. To take a photo, just select the camera and pick Take Photo of, where a list of Sims will appear. Select the Sim standing in front of the Backdrop.
To do a little test, place a Sim in a certain spot and snap three pictures; one with the Full Control Camera, another with the “Can You See Me Now” Camera, and the last one with ClickShot P10 Mirrorless Camera. The last two are the most expensive cameras in The Sims 4. Upon closer inspection, players will notice that the Iso Love Photos Camera has the most zoom capabilities, the highest photo quality, and is the only one that has a rotation option. Additionally, the other two cameras can only take a maximum of five pictures, while the Full Control Camera can take 25.
The Sims 4 is a monster of a game, especially in saves that have existed for a long time. It's not uncommon for players, even those with great PCs, to see some strange things happen around town when they play longer playthroughs like legacies. Sims stuck in idle animations are one of the main issue people tend to face.
