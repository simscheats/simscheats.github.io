## Error message when trying to install a sims 4 mod.

Hence you should navigate to the mod’s website and make sure that the mod which you downloaded is indeed that of Sims 4 and not of the earlier versions. You can easily check this by seeing the changelog or the category in which they are placed. Identify the incompatible mods and remove them.

@LottieGrayYT That's not the Sims 4 folder where you need to add mods. As the original instructions say, the correct folder is in Documents\Electronic Arts. Be sure to start your game at least once, so that this Sims 4 folder will be created.And please remove the Mods folder you created from the Sims 4 folder in Program files (x86). That data doesn't belong there and can only cause problems.
@Queen_Mia1228 Do you run the standard version of Sims 4, or the Legacy Edition? If you have the standard version, you'll need to make sure your mods are fully updated for the current patch. If you have the LE, you'll need to specifically download mods made for or confirmed to be compatible with the LE; the newer ones won't work.
Go to your Mods folder and right-click it. Again, copy it to your Desktop. Once you're sure you have a copy of your Mods folder on your Desktop, go ahead and delete the copy in your Sims 4 folder. Restart your game and play it for a few minutes. If your game runs without crashing or having errors, you know the issue is with one of your Mods. If it doesn't, you'll need to go out and repair your game (and the issue is something within your Sims 4 game itself).
If your Sims 4 mod isn’t working, the first step is to check the mod compatibility on its download page. Mods created for older Sims games usually aren’t compatible with Sims 4. And even those explicitly made for Sims 4 may not have been updated for the latest game version yet.

Identifying the problematic mod can be as easy as deleting the last mod you've downloaded, if the problem cropped up after that. Paste your Mods folder back into your Sims 4 folder and then sort your files by Date Modified. Delete the most recent mod/CC and restart your game, play for a few minutes and see if your game works. If so, you've found the problem mod.
Check that the mod itself is up-to-date. With the Sims 4, nearly every time a patch comes out, it breaks a variety of mods. Usually, the mod's creator will be aware of this and will update their website to notify players of this. Check the page you downloaded the mod from and then delete and reinstall the new version, if necessary. Sims websites like SimsVIP also keep a running tab of incompatible mods and CC after patches.
Remember that game mods and custom content are designed to work with genuine versions of The Sims 4. There is no guarantee that they will work with pirated versions of the game, so if you do have a pirated version and a mod isn't working, that could be why. The only way to fix this would be to buy a copy of The Sims 4 directly from Origin, where you can ensure the game will be patched regularly and compatible with all mods and custom content.
In this case, you should create a new household and check if it can load the mods. If Sims 4 mods not working issue disappear, it will be sure that this issue is caused by the household problem. You can give up the original household and use the new one.

## Mod not appearing in sims 4 game folder.

In Sims 4, an option is provided to allow players to enable or disable the mods in game according to their needs. If this option is disabled, you will definitely experience Sims 4 mods not showing up issue. So, you should firstly check if mods are enabled in your Sims 4. To do that, you need to:
@ThisIsMePlayingI'm sure the game has created a new mods folder in your game. Maybe you're looking in the wrong place. . The game is installed in two folders, One folder is in Program files and this should not be touched. Second folder is in Dokuments / Electronic Arts / The Sims4 and there must be a new mods folder in the game folder.I don't work for EA
Finally, uninstalling and reinstalling the Sims 4 is the last resort to fix mods notworking problem. You can completely remove the Sims 4 from your computer and then download the latest version of the game from the official website. Then, install the game according to the given instruction and check if Sims 4 mods not showing up issue is removed.
Lastly, if none of these step’s help, you may want to look online for users with a similar issue. Head to Sims 4 or EA Games forums and search for threads dedicated to that specific trait and the term “mod not working.” Perhaps, the issue is well-known, and The Sims 4 community has already found a solution.
Like mentioned before, Sims 4 rolled out an update where users were given an option in-game which allowed them to enable/disable the mods. Previously, this wasn’t the case and the game would automatically load all the mods as long as they were in the mods folder. In this solution, we will navigate to the in-game options and make sure that the option is enabled.
There was a universal issue in Sims 4 where at a point, the game stopped supporting mods altogether whether they were enabled or not. This caused a global outrage to players regarding the mod’s functionality and they were unable to customize their game in any way. Electronic Arts were fast to release an update that circumvented the issue. If you have an older version of Sims 4 installed, it is recommended that you follow the method below to update it to the latest build.
@LottieGrayYT There are two sets of files for the game: the program files are where you installed them, common path is the one you mentioned: C:\Program Files (86)\Origin Games.The user files are located in DocumentsElectronic Arts in a folder called The Sims 4. Inside that folder is a folder called Mods, this is where you install your mods and CC.Detailed tutorial:https://www.carls-sims-4-guide.com/tutorials/mods-cc.phpI would suggest you delete the mods folder you put in with the program files, and do a Repair in Origin for good measure:OriginMy Game Library right click The Sims 4 icon, choose Repair in the drop-down menu.Then install your mods in the right folder.
I've noticed a problem with my sims 4 game: Any of the mods I've downloaded and installed for it won't show up in game. I am certain that I have installed them correctly to the mods folder and mods are enabled in my game so they should show up. But they don't. Any idea what is causing this or how I could fix this?
