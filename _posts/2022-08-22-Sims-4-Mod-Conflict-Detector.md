Mod conflict detector promises a dynamic screen layout for Sims players. The mod began with the ability to detect junk TS4 files and stray files. These do not include .zip files. Instead, it can pinpoint files that do not belong in your Mods folder. These files will then be disabled or deleted straight from the program. Its prowess for detection can also be done on duplicated files and conflicting ResourceKeys. Any files that need to be removed will be opened in s4pi.
Once youâ€™ve installed and opened the program, it will prompt you to scan your files for available mods for The Sims 4. Scanned mods will appear as a list in the Scan Results tab, and the program will tell you about the mod types and if there are conflicts.
