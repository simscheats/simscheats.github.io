Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
The Sims 4 is truly at home on PC, but that hasn’t stopped EA and Maxis from bringing the popular life-sim game to PS4 and Xbox One. Of course, some players may be wondering if it’s possible to get Sims 4 mods on PS4 and Xbox One. Here’s what you need to know.
I remember downloading a free trial of Sims 4 and being really disappointed with it. Some of the mods sound like they should be included in the game already, such as the MC Command Center. However, reading this has gotten me all nostalgic for the older games, so I might give Sims 4 a try and keep these mods bookmarked to add after playing the original version for a bit. Thanks for the information.
The Sims 4 on Xbox One is a simulation game that puts you in charge of the daily lives of the titular sims. It's an offshoot of the massively popular Sim City series from Maxis, and it provides a similar type of sandbox gameplay. The game is different every time you play, and there are a ton of things to do and see, but Sims 4 cheats are the best way to get right into things.

To help you navigate what's on offer, here’s a lineup of the best Sims 4 mods, from the little tweaks, to the digital life-changers. Make sure to read the installation section, and double check for any conflicts to make sure you’re not running two that will butt heads.
You just need to look at the game’s strong library of user generated content to see what’s really keeping the lights on. The Sims 4 mods scene is thriving, with plenty of weird and wonderful additions to the base game. We’ve compiled a list of what we think are the best Sims 4 mods accompanied with links to all the download pages. Be sure to read the install instructions for each mod.
While patiently waiting for more news on a possible The Sims 5, however, the best way to spice up the current version of the game is to add some custom content and mods. There are some incredible modders out there, who have not just made The Sims 4 better but also brought back crucial features from previous game. Here are the best mods every Simmer needs for better gameplay.
The Sims 4 on Xbox One has a number of expansions that add exciting new locales and mechanics, and even new skills. If you have any of these expansions, you may be interested in seeing how the new skills work. By entering the following codes, you can alter the skill level of the expansion skills. All of these codes are used in the same way as the codes found in the previous section, but they only work if you have the expansions.

## Sims 4 modding for xbox one can be done by anyone with the right tools and knowledge.

Sadly, again, the answer is a resounding no. You cannot get Sims 4 mods on Xbox One. In fact, both mods and custom content are not supported on the Xbox One, just like the PS4. While this may come as disappointing news to some fans, mod support on consoles for games in general tends to be rare.
You can find many mods over at ModTheSims, which hosts a wealth of community-made free mods for you to download and enjoy as you please. Installing mods is simple enough – all you need to do is drag the mod files over to the game’s mod folder. In a typical setup, this should be Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods.
Better Build/Buy might be one of the slightly more involved mods to set up, but it’s worth the few extra steps. It makes building a lot easier, giving you access to hidden Sims 4 objects you’d normally have to work harder for or use a cheat to get. It comes loaded with other features as well, from expanding your build catalog from two rows to five, clone objects without restrictions, and find items easier thanks to their technical labels.
I mean... whatever they do to Sims 4 on Xbox, they have to do for PS4 because they are the only two consoles that we can actually purchase this game on. But I totally agree with you, the mods are definetly useful I just love the clothing, hair (ETC) that comes with it.
The success of the game is driven by a thriving and lively bunch of modders who are responsible for creating tons of weird and wonderful additions to the game. If you’re looking for some excellent mods that will enhance your Sims 4 gaming experience, here are some great options you should consider.
The good news is modding your game isn’t as hard as you think. Sims Community is here to help. We’ll be clarifying any technical terms you might come across while looking for mods and CC, dispelling common myths about mods and CC, and walking you through the process of installing and maintaining your mods and CC step-by-step.
Unfortunately, you cannot get Sims 4 mods on PS4. This is sadly one of the features that didn’t make the cut when the game was ported to console. This news was shared by Michael Duke, a Senior Producer on the game, who replied to a tweet regarding mod support for The Sims 4 on PS4 back in 2017.
If EA wanted to bring mods/CC to Sims 4 they could do so on either console, but that isn’t going to happen because EA does not support mods. The console games that support modding do not have external mods, they are downloaded via a content manager in-game (Steam Workshop primarily). With how often mods break on PC, it would be a technical nightmare for both EA and the mod creator keeping their files updated and compatible with the console games, as well as the PC game which are running on completely different platforms.
