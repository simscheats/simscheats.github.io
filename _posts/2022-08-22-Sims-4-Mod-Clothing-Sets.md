## Create custom clothing for your sims 4 characters with these mod clothes sets.

The Sims 4’s Create A Sim includes a bundle of clothing pieces that are already presentable to you. However, there’s a whole different set of clothing items that show up in Create A Sim only after you complete a certain milestone / level in a certain Career / Skill. These can be easily accessed through the “Unlocked” filter tag:

They function the same way as clothes do in The Sims 3. With Get to Work, Sims can purchase pre-made outfits on mannequins, and with High School Years, Sims can put together custom looks to buy at a thrift store, or buy outfits on the phone app Trendi. Sims can have up to five different outfits for each category that can be accessed in Create a Sim. The hairstyle of a Sim's first everyday outfit is automatically applied to every other category, unless the player manually chooses a different hairstyle for a particular outfit. Dogs have access to two clothing categories, everyday and walking, and cats only have access to everyday. However, they can still be given five different outfits for each category.
Sims can change and plan outfits with a dresser. Most outfits are one-piece outfits. However, Everyday clothes for children through elders can also be bought as separate tops and bottoms, which allows players to mix-and-match tops and bottoms for unique Everyday two-piece outfits. Beginning with Bon Voyage, changing booths could be used as dressers, giving Sims the ability to wear outfits they had just bought.
Would you look at these sleeves! We could easily find sophisticated clothes for our female sims but this isn’t usually the case when we’re trying to dress up our male characters. This sweater set will definitely spice up their wardrobes. With patterned and solid options, this set contains 20 sweaters. Install.
Another way to change your Sims’ work outfit is to use a mod called “Plan Career Outfit.” The mod adds interactions to all dressers, Get Together closets, and mirrors. It can also be incorporated into any object that already features the Change Sim interactions, meaning it’ll automatically work with Custom Content creations.

In this pack you’re going to get 3 hairs that work for so many sims, there’s a fun tank top with interesting graphics on it and it works really well with high-waisted bottoms. Pair this with a gorgeous high-waisted skirt and your sim will look super adorable!
Sims wear Normal clothes by default, and they are the only clothing category available in Create a Sim. All other categories have a default outfit, which is automatically assigned to Sims when they are created.[n It is not possible to purchase Normal outfits, as wardrobes contain all available everyday clothes. Prior to Hot Date, the wardrobe's "Change Clothes" option would change a Sim into the next available Normal outfit for his or her age, gender, and skin tone, even if it didn't use the same body type. If Hot Date or a later expansion is installed, the "Change Clothes" option opens a dialog which allows the player to flip through previews of the Normal outfits available for the Sim's age, gender, skin tone, and body type. However, custom wardrobes based on pre-Hot Date wardrobes still work in the old way.
Work clothing can be a huge problem in Sims 4, but using cheat codes and mods is a great way to solve it. They allow you to change the attire of your Sims and NPCs within minutes to make it more suitable to their occupations. Thus, you can create a perfectly dressed workforce regardless of your platform.
After choosing the group of sims that will be wearing the uniform, you have many options including changing into the outfit, modifying the outfit, clone thread, outfit merging rules, seasonal and region restrictions, rename and delete thread. We found that renaming each thread is important if there are more than one. Restricting outfits to/from specific weather or specific regions gives the Simmer the ability to further design their own world. That will be really helpful if you want certain Situation Jobs to dress differently between Sulani and Mt. Komorebi! Seasonal Restrictions requires Seasons and/or Snowy Escape.

## Select from a variety of different clothing sets to dress up your sims 4 characters for any occasion.

There are many categories of clothing in The Sims 3. Sims can choose their outfit for everyday, formalwear, sleepwear, swimwear, athletic, career [TS3:ST], and outerwear [TS3:S]. The undies category has been merged with sleepwear, so Sims will wear sleepwear after they WooHoo, for instance. Career outfits can be customized since patch 31, equivalent to Showtime, which enables more choice for Sims in their career or profession. Outerwear is worn by Sims during winter or cold weather, and it keeps Sims warm longer than wearing anything else.
As with the hair and makeup, clothing choices are much more limited in Sims 4 compared to Sims 3. You cannot use any customized patterns, and any color changes must be chosen from among the colors that come with particular clothes. However, you can search for specific types of clothing using the little left-pointing arrow underneath the clothing category. In this screen, we see Christine using the filters to shop for a black-colored bottom for her party attire.
Clothes are probably the most essential part of playing The Sims 4. This is because they give your Sims the opportunity to reflect their respective personalities.
