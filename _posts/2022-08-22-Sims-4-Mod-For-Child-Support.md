## Sims 4 mod allows players to enter into contracts that allow for child support payments.

Now, this mod takes me back to the Sims 2 with its ability to put your Sims kids into private school. So far, there is not a benefit in enrolling your Sims into a private school, but it’s a great way to relive the older games. If you remember anything from that time, the schematics are similar to inviting the headmaster over and impressing him so that your child can enter a private school. You pay tuition and can remove your child from private school as well.

For a simple combination of the essentials, the Pregnancy Mega Mod by scumbobo and java7nerd is an ideal pick for those who just want to have a bit more control over their offspring and increase the amount of storytelling that's available. This pregnancy mod for The Sims 4 is a combination of a few different ones and lets the player see how many babies a Sim will have, as well as their genders.
I think the bills are really unrealistic as well I mean I have never had a mansion like some of my Sims haha but they will be paying 30k? I think someone has mentioned a mod that can make them more realistic. But I'm not sure if it overlaps with the mod that you use for child support.
Not all mods related to pregnancy for The Sims 4 are necessarily happy. However, they can still be useful when trying to make dramatic and extremely emotional stories in a game as happy-go-lucky as The Sims 4. The Pregnant Aging & Death mod by PolarBearSims does that job perfectly.
Pekesims fixes this issue by introducing the possibility of even more babies with this The Sims 4 pregnancy mod. Be warned, however, that raising this many children is going to be a major challenge, but at the same time, it really does make things a bit more interesting. For extreme family players only!

That is until this Sims 4 pregnancy mod by Tanja1986 was released. Through the power of science, anyone can now become pregnant if they so wish, which just takes away a ton of hassle from the game and makes romance gameplay so much more interesting and diverse for Simmers.
If the Household you are playing is on the receiving end, you now have the option to have a percentage of Child Support go to each child and then to the Household account with anything leftover. The default is all going to the Household account. This payment system is outside of the Bill paying side, so you will still need to pay for your Sim's Household Services still.
NOTE 4: Custody availability: available to married sims, Significant Others, and any Sim separating through my system, directly under the normal menus. For other cases (parents with no relationship, etc), so long as they had a child together after this mod was installed, they should have the options under ‘Actions’ instead of under the normal menus.
Personally, I feel like playing with children in your Sims household is mundane. You typically have to focus and make sure their needs are fulfilled while leveling up skills and having good grades so that they are ready for college. They can’t even handle money or make purchases until they’re older. There isn’t too much to say about this mod besides the fact that it creates more of a dynamic in the parenting portion of TheSims gameplay. It makes the interaction between you and your child a bit more realistic. You can set the number as high and low as you would like or not set it at all. If you complete chores, you can reward your sims with an allowance.

## Sims 4 mod allows players to control their relationships with other sims.

This mod pairs well with the Personality Please mod. The personality mod gives your Sims some major autonomy and it’s pretty adaptive in giving you various interactions based on your relationship with other sims, their personalities, and moods. The interactions between your sims and their partner is significantly increased as well as self-interactions. You can also plan for pregnancy with your partner. It’s pretty realistic gameplay and provides a layer of depth you just can’t find in the base games.
Dating and relationships in Sims 4 feels simulated, superficial and rudimentary so we’re thankful for Wonderful Whims adding complexities to it. This mod focuses on dating, relationships, and pregnancy, allowing you to set everything from the traits your Sims will find attractive to their sexual and dating preferences to birth control. With it, dating in Sims 4 will feel much more like real world dating (minus online dating).
If you're fed up with your Sims having meaningless chit-chats with each other, then this mod from PolarBearSims (opens in new tab) could be just the ticket to spice up their interactions. This extensive mod introduces many changes, but one of the key features is removing idle chat from conversations. This means that instead of nattering, your Sims will have to interact with each other, and the mod will decide how this goes down based on the existing relationship between the Sims, plus their character traits and current mood. Sit back and watch how things pan out, but prepare for fireworks if two Sims don't get along.
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.
On top of those options, a variety of features dealing with relationships, preferences, and attractions have been added in, somewhat inspired by The Sims 2's attraction system. It's possible to have polyamorous relationships and even an open relationship with another Sim.
In this same module, relationship settings control how fast or slow relationships, both platonic and romantic, decay. You can also enable teen parenting and control breakup settings, like which Sim moves out when partners break up, or if children are involved, which partner they'll live with, and which will pay child support.
The module, called Break Up, Make Up, and Everything In Between, + Co-parenting, adds more depth to the process of breaking up in the game. Normally, married Sims always have the Divorce option available under the Mean social category. Choosing that option will instantly make the Sims divorced and any children who happen to witness this interaction between their parents will feel sad about their parents breaking up for a while. That’s basically it. With this module, married Sims can separate for a period of time before either deciding to go ahead with a divorce or get back together.
