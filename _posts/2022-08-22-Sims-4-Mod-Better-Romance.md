The makers of The Sims 4 have thought about a lot. But when it comes to romantic interactions the game tends to be too simplistic from time to time. Luckily, there is a super active community creating awesome Sims 4 Mods out there, having created a number of helpful and effective additions to the game, improving the romance life of your sims. We have collected the 15 best Sims 4 Romance Mods you should check out.
Yes, I am a sucker for romance. I admit it. That's why when I play The Sims 4, there is always some kind of romantic storyline that worked into the mix. I enjoy watching the drama unfold, watching those first kisses and first heartbreaks. I love seeing "happily ever afters" in progress.
For a game that is essentially an incredibly elaborate dollhouse, you would expect the game’s romance features to be well fleshed out and enjoyable. However, sometimes the sims fall short in the romance department, so responsibility has fallen onto the modding community to do what EA should have (and more). Here are some of the finest and, on some occasions, filthiest mods created by the sims community.
There are various interactions for couples in the game, but they are vanilla and can get quite monotonous with the same basic interplays. But we all know love is about having fun, being vulnerable, laughing, crying, memories and heartbreaks (yes.) So, below are the lists of the most remarkable modifications of all time that would transform the way your sims experience the series of chemical reactions in their body, called love!

To get a boyfriend or girlfriend in the Sims 4, start by sending your sim to a social location, so they can meet other sims. Once you find another sim, have your sim introduce themselves, so they start talking. During the conversation, look for positive green plus signs over the sims' heads to see if they're getting along. Once you've built a friendship between two sims, click the "Romance" option and choose "Flirt." If both sims respond positively to the flirting, continue choosing "Romance" conversation options until the "Romance" bar reaches at least 30 percent. From here, you should be able to select "Ask to Be Boyfriend" or "Ask to Be Girlfriend" from the "Romance" menu. If your sim gets rejected, try again when your "Romance" bar reaches 50 percent.

Meaningful Stories is perfect for players that appreciate a slightly more challenging system to work with. Now, Sims are also no longer ‘happy’ by default – making it so that events such as gaining a new partner contribute more fully towards this emotional state.
People have moved across lands, burned villages, started wars, and ended them; they drank poison and swore to die, all to reunite with their lover. Because love is a crazy feeling, there’s madness and eerie calm, all existing at once. While all of this is experienced by people in real life, Sims 4 lacks all the fantastic elements in the story of two people falling in love.
I love the way the Sims 4 did this and it made me extremely happy to see the progression. I wish that Skyrim did allow for more activity and interaction with married NPC’s. I was impressed that they give you free reign over which gender you decide to marry; I think that’s fantastic. I just wish there was more you could do with your new spouse (not even from a sexual standpoint, just in general with social interaction).

Thank you for the advice, I tried repairing the game without cc or mods as well as deleting the cache files (but not the actual folder itself). Then when I went into the game there were still no romantic options so I moved the sim out and back in but still nothing. I also noticed that no matter what sim I get to know in the world, there are no romance options either because I thought it might of been with just these two sims.
This mod adds romantic interactions to the game that are super cute to watch play out between sims who are all in lurve. Goose (from Sims 2), romantic hug and romantic selfie are just a few that are included. Install this mod before the Romance Festival and watch all the couples get all snuggly during the event. It’s so cute!
