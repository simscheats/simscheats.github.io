## Sims 4 mods can be downloaded from various locations, depending on the type of mod.

Next up, you’ll need to download the mod from the internet. While we can’t tell you where to look, there are many online resources for Sims 4 mods and CC. You shouldn’t have to pay for any mods (although some modders will accept donations, as developing content can take days of work). Popular content libraries include “Mod The Sims” and “The Sims Resource”, but you can find them on social media or through popular YouTube simmers.

Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from. Files will then be placed in your designated downloads folder on your PC or Mac, and will then need to be moved to the appropriate folder for the game to recognise them.
Installing Mods in The Sims 4The process for downloading both CC and Mods is the same, so we will cover them both at once. They are installed in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Open Windows Explorer or Finder on Mac. Click your Documents folder, Electronic Arts, then The Sims 4. If you have trouble finding it, look for the Users folder on C:, click the User of the PC (in my case, Carl) then proceed to Documents (or My Documents) and go from there. For windows users, Documents is usually on the left in the menu as you can see in the screenshot.
To help you navigate what's on offer, here’s a lineup of the best Sims 4 mods, from the little tweaks, to the digital life-changers. Make sure to read the installation section, and double check for any conflicts to make sure you’re not running two that will butt heads.
Sims 4 Mod ManagerThere is an option for those of you who do not want to deal with unzipping files and would like the ability to easily enable/disable mods. Raxdiam's Sims 4 Mod Manager is a solution for that. It's got a lot of features, is fairly easy to use, and if you explore the site you can even find a video explaining how to use it.

When you downloaded your game, you chose a folder to install The Sims 4 to. Navigate to it and locate the Mods folder. You can usually find this in Documents Electronic Arts The Sims 4 Mods, but you might have installed it in another location. We recommend using File Explorer’s built-in search box to help you locate the folder.
Looking for some Sims 4 mods to keep things fresh? Whether you want to add more meaningful character interactions, or get a little wacky by turning your character into a sorcerer, there are all sorts of Sims mods that cater to whatever way you feel like playing.
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
About Mods and Custom ContentMods and Custom Content are wildly popular among Sims 4 players, but if you're new to the franchise you may be unaware what treasures await those who ravenously scour the web for the latest downloads. There is far more free content available to download than is included in the base game and all game/stuff packs combined. In this guide, I'll teach you how to install CC and mods, explain what they are and offer some direction on where to go from here by providing links to sites where you can binge-download CC for your game.

## Mods can be downloaded from the game's website.

Before we get into mods for the game, you need to know how to install them. Compared to other PC Games, modding this one is quite simple. First, find the mod that you want to install and download the folder onto your computer. After that, follow these steps to install it into your game:
To do this, start the game, click on the Menu button (the three buttons on the top right corner), Game Options, Other and then tick the Enable Custom Content and Mods box. Then hit the Apply Changes button and restart your game. The next time you start it up, your settings will be saved and you'll be able to play with mods!
Once you're in game, you'll also need to enable mods in your game settings by going to your Options menu under the Other tab. Make sure to check off "Enable Custom Content and Mods" and "Script Mods Allowed" depending on what you've chosen to install. You'll need to restart your game afterwards.
Once you have created a mods folder, you then need to download some mods/cc from a creators site and place those items manually into the newly created mods folder - unzipping if needed.Next, in-game you have to allow mods/cc to be used. Options MenuGame OptionsOther - then check 'Enable Custom Content and Mods' and enable 'Script Mods' if you have downloaded any.
Unlike the game itself, mods don't automatically update. When a mod breaks then you will need to check where you got it from to see if there's a new version. If there is, download it, and replace the original files. If there isn't, remove the files until there's an update.
Hi, I have a problem, I followed all the steps, but when I download the mods and put them in the folder it still doesn't appear in the game, there is this window telling me about the mods that I downloaded but they still don't appear in the game... Can someone help me?
Whether you’re using Steam or Origin to play the game, the process for downloading the mods doesn’t change. Since Steam hasn’t enabled the Workshop for Origin games, you can’t keep a list of mods directly on the platform and have to download each mod manually.
Always check out the installation instructions for any mod you download just to be sure there aren't any more additional steps. Most should just be a quick matter of copying files over. Do keep an eye out for any dependencies your mods have, such as meshes creates by other modders that you'll also need to install.
