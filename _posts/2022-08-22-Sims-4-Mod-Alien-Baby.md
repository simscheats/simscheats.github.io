## There are a number of mods available that let you create a sim that is an alien baby. these mods can change the base game files so that your sim becomes an alien baby, or they can add new content that lets you play as an alien baby.

Currently, there are three methods to create an Alien; in CAS, get abducted by Aliens, and have children with one. The first one is the easiest. Simmers can click on the + icon in Create A Sim (CAS) to add another Sim to the Household. There is an option to add Occults and one of them is Aliens.

Alien-Sim PregnanciesThis used to be much more complicated but a patch changed that. Male Sims will only get pregnant by abduction, so Alien-Sim pregnancies are now just like normal pregnancies (the female gets pregnant via try for baby) except that the baby will be a Hybrid. In order to guarantee a pure alien, both Sims need to be Aliens.
Once the baby is born it will always belong to the alien life state, with all the special abilities belonging to that occult creature type. There's even an achievement in the Origin version of the game called 'Special Delivery' that specifically requires you to have a male Sim give birth to an alien baby.
Aliens are one of the Occults that can be created at the start of The Sims 4. They can do everything normal Sims can, from going to school, working in a career, and having kids. However, they have a few abilities and interactions that can make the gameplay more intriguing.
Hybrid AliensIt would appear that any pregnancy involving a regular Sim and alien will result in a Hybrid (thanks oshizu!). A half Sim half Alien does not have access to the Alien powers, but has hair as well as the Alien's unique socials. In order to have a baby with alien powers, you must either get abducted as a male Sim or have two Aliens try for baby. Using the Satellite from the Scientist career is a good way to encourage an Alien visit, now that the rate they are abducted has been reduced by Maxis. You can also invite Aliens to move in, of course.

Well my regular sim couple are not aliens but the first time that I tried for babies they both ended up pregnant and she's not an alien. I'm really confused about this because is there any way to create aliens in Create a Sim? This is happened twice now which ended in two babies being born back to back by each parent. It actually gave me the reward for having an alien baby lol so I'm just really confused please help?
It's possible to get a pure Alien baby without two aliens, but it's not guaranteed. A hybrid's involvement (as parent) in pregnancy makes the outcomes more complex. Since hybrids have alien DNA, a hybrid + alien could have either a hybrid or full-blooded alien (50/50). A hybrid + hybrid could have a regular Sim (33%), hybrid (33%) or full-blooded alien (33%).
There are many ways to play the game and you don't need to have Sim babies if you don't want to; however, if you plan on playing a legacy game in The Sims 4 with multiple generations of the same Sim family, you'll probably want to have your Sims trying for babies pretty regularly.
