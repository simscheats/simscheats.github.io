## Creating and installing mods for sims 4.

After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4 .. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled.. This mostly goes for people who don’t have folders within the Mods folder yet or have made folders, but there’s nothing in them.. Locate the downloaded files on your computer and then move the files manually to The Sims 4 Mods folder.. In the Mods folder, create a Mods Tutorial (any name will suffice) subfolder and move all of the “.package” files from the downloads folder into the Mods Tutorial folder.. will be stored in the “CAS” folder, Build/Buy CC should go in the “Build Buy Mods” folder, and so on.. Also, by putting newly downloaded mods in a separate folder, you can launch the game and decide whether or not you like the new mods you’ve downloaded.. If you’re having trouble finding the custom content you’ve downloaded, click the small arrow next to “Feminine,” click content, and check the box next to “Custom Content” so that the hair section shows only custom content you’ve downloaded.. One popular script mod is The Sims 4 MC Command Center Mod created by the user, Deaderpool.. We’ve already gone over how to turn on script mods, but where do you place the MC Command Center mod in the Mods folder?. First, make sure the modules and packages are placed into the same folder and that the folder is no more than one level deep in The Sims 4 mod folder structure.

Downloading custom content and mods for The Sims 4 should be as easy as clicking download on whichever site you’re browsing from.. Custom content and mods aren’t without their problems, so we heavily recommend organising your downloaded content well and creating subfolders that categorise the type of content you have downloaded, i.e hairstyles, clothing, objects etc.. Note that Script mods, which usually consist of several files, cannot be placed into subfolders, so we recommend creating a single folder for that Script Mod within the main Sims 4 mods folder, and placing all relevant files there.. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ and ‘Script mods Allowed’ to turn on your custom content.. To check your custom content and mods have been installed correctly, you can view this in-game by pressing ESC, then go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’, and clicking ‘View custom content’.. Downloaded objects will be viewable in Buy and Build Mode, which you can filter by custom content only by heading to ‘Filter Items’ on the right hand side, selecting ‘Content’, and then ticking ‘custom content’ from the drop down menu.. Modthesims.info : One of the biggest Sims 4 custom content sites that contains what feels like a bottomless pit of Sims 4 CC for you to explore.. We recommend using the tags #The Sims 4, #Sims 4 custom content, #TS4 CC and #Simblr to find custom content and creators.. Everything in The Sims 4 requires a mesh, so when downloading custom content that uses a new mesh, rather than an already existing mesh in the game, ensure that it is also downloaded or your items will not appear.
By default, The Sims 4 has an option to disable mods in the game. Before you get started with playing with mods and custom content, you'll need to start up your Sims 4 game and turn mods on (you'll also need to do this after each patch that is released, as the game options default back to mods being turned off).
If your mods are not functioning properly in Sims 4, there are some free tools created by the modding community that will help you find and delete the files. The process can be tedious, but the best way is using Sims 4 Studio (a free tool for making custom content) and Sims 4 Tray Importer.
@Teenybober Do you know where your user data folder is? This Sims 4 folder, not the one with the game files but a separate folder in a different directory, stores saves, saved households and builds, screenshots, etc. as well as mods. The game itself should create a Mods folder by default there. In Windows and macOS, the user data is in Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4, although I have no idea if your setup would look different.If you're not sure where to find this content, load your game to the Main Menu, click Load Game, then hover over the folder icon under the name of your save. It will list the full file path to that save. So just find that same Sims 4 folder, and you should see a Mods folder inside.

That's the basics on how to install mods and custom content for The Sims 4, as well as how to troubleshoot, uninstall and keep your Mods folder organised! Got any questions or suggestions that I haven't covered above? Feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to help!
If you want to browse through some mods without having to visit and access a tonne of websites then we recommend taking a look at these sites that curate and host mods and custom content :. Mod The Sims hosts a huge amount of mods for The Sims 2, 3, and 4 .. Once you have the mod file downloaded it should be copied into the mods folder.. "Enable Custom Content and Mods" - This enables all custom content and non-script mods.. Every time a new patch is released it can break your mods and cause issues since mods alter the game code in the same way patches do.. The best way to ensure your mods are up to date is to check the page you got the mod from and look for either an update or confirmation that the mod is fine.
Now that your game is patched and you've got a proper extraction tool on your computer, it's time to download some custom content or mods that you'd like to use in your game! If you don't already have one in mind, I've written some articles on some great custom content sites and mods for the Sims 4. Feel free to browse those articles to find something of your liking!
After launching The Sims 4 and enabling mods in your game, locate the Mods folder for The Sims 4. The default path for your Sims 4 folder is located in your Documents folder. The Mods folder will generate inside the Sims 4 folder once you have launched the game with mods enabled. In the Mods folder, there is a “Resource.cfg” file. Right-click to open it using a simple text editing program, such as Notepad. You should see something like this, but on one line:

## Finding and installing mods.

Before you start installing mods and CC, you need to locate your Mods folder. This is where you need to place your downloaded content for your game to be able to read and install it—if you put it anywhere else, it won't work. Content that ends in the .package file extension goes here.
This is pretty simple to do. Make a new folder on your desktop and just call it "Test Mods" or something similar. Take half of the items you have in your Mods folder and paste them into this folder. Test your game and see if the problem persists. If not, you know the problem content is in that other batch of mods. If so, the trouble mod is still in your game, and you'll need to repeat the process again.
To do this, start the game, click on the Menu button (the three buttons on the top right corner), Game Options, Other and then tick the Enable Custom Content and Mods box. Then hit the Apply Changes button and restart your game. The next time you start it up, your settings will be saved and you'll be able to play with mods!
There are several ways you can organize your Mods folder. I like to do mine by categories, as seen in the picture above. This doesn't really do anything special during the gameplay, but it allows me to easily find content in my folders, install new content, and delete or update old content.
A window will open up. Click on the Add button and then navigate to your Mods folder in the window. Highlight all the mods you want to merge together, and select open. Click on the Merge button. The program will prompt you to rename your new merged .package file. Give it a unique name and select Save.
When clicking around and downloading mods, it’s very important to read the fine print. You’ll come across a huge selection of CC that’s compatible with the base game (no packs required), however, plenty of available mods will require a pack for one reason or another (like a re-texture of a base game item).
Open up the Downloads folder and then right-click on the content you've just downloaded. If you're using WinRar, you'll see an icon that looks like a stack of books. Click on the option that says, "Extract to (mod name)". The file will then extract into a folder.
Uninstalling CC and Mods is as simple as going to your Mods folder and deleting them. Right-click on whichever file you want to get rid of, select Delete, and then the next time you start up the game, that custom content or mod will no longer be in your game.
