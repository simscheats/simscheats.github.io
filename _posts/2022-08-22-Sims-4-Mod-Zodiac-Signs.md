If You Are New To This Mod, This Mod Aims To Convert Zodiac Signs From The Sims 2 And Make It As Good As I Can Into The Sims 4 Without It Taking Up Trait Slots, These Zodiac Signs Are In The Rewards Store! List Of NEW FEATURES: Not One, Not 2 But 4 Compatibility Types! In Older Versions Of My Mod, I Had Only 2 Compatibility Types, Bad And Good. Not Only I Overhauled The Compatibility Between Zodiac Signs, But You Now Have 4 TYPES Of Compatibility, Amazing, Good, Bad And Terrible! I have stopped looking atzodiacsigns-horoscope for Compatibility Ideas because I just didn’t like them that much, they were too simplistic, so I looked forward to Sims 2 Compatibility This is how the Zodiac Signs in the Sims 2 work (And take this as a ‘compatibility list’ of my mod aswell).
We all know the 12 signs of the zodiac cycle. They are determined by your date of birth and a lot of people swear by them! If you really love the zodiac signs and the Sims 4, then the Sims 4 Zodiac Challenge is for you! The main objective is to go through 12 generations, one for each sign. For each generation, your sim must complete their zodiac sign aspiration and find a compatible spouse!
Zodiac signs returned in The Sims 3: Late Night and are carried forward with patch 17. They have no effect on personality or lifestyle, but they do make it easier to have contact with people of certain zodiac signs. For example, a Pisces will be attracted to a Scorpio, Cancer, Capricorn, Virgo and Taurus.
Gemini sims are unapologetically themselves. They don’t care
what people think or say about them. But be careful, they get bored so easily.
Geminis love to say they don’t care about something, but then rant about the
thing that they said that they don’t care about. They’re very bipolar.

There are some premade Sims with mismatched zodiac signs which are different from the common mismatches listed above. An example of this is Patrizio Monty who is a Sagittarius but has the personality of a Cancer rather than a Libra while Nervous Subject is an Aquarius but had the personality of a Virgo (if its crawled through boolprop testingcheatsenabled true by the player) rather than a Sagittarius as well.
When creating a new Sim in The Sims and The Sims 2, the Sim will be given the Zodiac sign that's closest to the personality that was chosen. As the player assigns and reassigns personality points, the display will change to show which sign the Sim will have with that mix of points. Zodiac signs returned in The Sims 3: Late Night and in patch 17. They do not affect a Sim's personality or lifestyle.
In real life, a person's zodiac sign (also called an astrological sign) is determined by their date of birth. Thus, two people born on the same day will share a zodiac sign. In-game, however, Sims may be born on the same day but have different signs, since a Sim's sign is determined by their personality and not by their birth date.
Aries are the most honest sign in the entire zodiac, but
loooovveee to have things go their way. Aries sims are some crazy sims and have
severe anger management issues and also have jealousy issues. They hate being
disrespected and have a slight sense of entitlement. However, they are loving
people. Aries are very competitive and talented. They try to be the best at
anything that they can do.
