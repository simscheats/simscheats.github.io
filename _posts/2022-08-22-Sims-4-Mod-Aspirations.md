There are a lot of mods for The Sims 4 that completely overhaul and expand on the game's existing systems; even new players are looking to the modding community to add depth to their Sims experience. That's great for a lot of Simmers, but what about those who prefer a more vanilla play style and like to play the game how it was made?
But before you use this aspiration, you HAVE to download the whim overhaul mod that’s listed in my ‘mods I can’t live without’ post.Since the sims team up and abandoned the whim system, this mod will update the game with whims for all of the expansion and game packs.
There is nothing better than digging deep into the world of mods in The Sims 4. They seriously change how you can play the game and these sims 4 custom aspirations are going to make playing so much more fun. Aspirations are awesome and when paired with custom traits you can make the absolute best and most interesting sims ever. Happy Playing!
This mod has reached more than 110,000 downloads at ModTheSims. And if you’re tired of creating Sims with only a handful of traits, this mod is a must-have for you. By randomizing your Sims’ traits and aspirations as they age up, you’ll always have Sims with unique characters. And that’s a big plus in my book.

The 4 levels of this aspiration are Amateur, Semi-Pro, Pro, and Photo-Artist. The way your Sim takes photos in the game is changed and improved with this mod. It has a lot of downloads on ModTheSims and I recommend it for all photography lovers out there.
There are already some pre-existing aspirations to play in The Sims 4, but it's pretty easy after playing for a while to get bored of them. Luckily, there are many different aspiration mods to try out. Here is our pick for the top five aspiration mods for The Sims 4.
First up on our list of sims 4 custom aspirations is the self-sufficient aspiration which requires you to have The Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle. This aspiration’s description says “This sim wants to shun the cycle of consumerism by growing, recycling, and crafting all their own needs.”
These custom teen aspirations for the sims 4 are a must-have!! We all know how boring the teen sims are in the sims 4. This aspiration pack comes with 15 NEW aspirations exclusively for your teen sims to give them more depth and make playing with teens WAY more fun.

## Create mods that improve the game experience.

This mod reworks Aspirations to get rid of their multiple levels/goals. Instead, they now have only one goal. They also all reward the same amount of satisfaction points (5,000). The result is a game which doesn’t just encourage following a single path, and makes Sims feel more individual. It also encourages exploring different areas of the game. I don’t think I’ve played certain careers or done certain activities ever just because they weren’t tied to an Aspiration, and this mod helps alleviate that issue.
Thanks to Xbrettface for creating this great modification. It’s such a great way to improve this aspect of the game that I recommended it to everyone! And if you are looking for further mods related to restaurants, you may have a look at this blog post: The Best Sims 4 Restaurant Mods.
Right off the bat, this mod is for non-ambitious Sims who just want to mind their own business and avoid all possible problems. It actually adds a new reward trait that specifically makes these Sims want to avoid problems in life. Completing this aspiration gives your Sim a Pleased reward trait too which makes it less inclined to have negative states.
In the vanilla game, Build-Buy only displays a couple of rows at a time, so players are at the mercy of the scroll function (which can be tedious with a lot of DLC installed. The game has a lot of items!) The mod is also easy to toggle on or off; just press "~" or "1" on the keyboard to expand or minimize the menu any time.
The Expanded Rewards Store mod by Frimlin is a mod that allows you to access all the aspiration reward traits in Sims 4 without wasting time. Some rewards are expensive, but some are fairly cheap too. You’ll definitely need a lot of satisfaction points for this, so make sure you get some quickly.
I’ve had this extension in my Sims 4 game now for such a long time already because it really adds value to the game. And that’s that kind of user-created content you should certainly try, too! So if you’re interested, click the link below to download it!
Now, even if players do turn them back on, Whims are not nearly as personalized as they were in the Base Game. Enter: Whim Overhaul. This mod creates new Whims based on all of the currently released packs, increases family-based Whims (with Parenthood activities incorporated), and decreases Whims to buy things... like Bee Boxes. Players can pick and choose which packages to install based on which packs they have, or which ones they want more Whims for.
You will definitely love how this mod plays out in-game, especially if you like aspirations based on sci-fi. This mod is focusing exactly on that and adds a UFO Investigator Aspiration in the base game. However, your Sim will first start as a Stargazer and move on to Conspiracy Theorist and Contactee before they reach the level of UFO Investigator.
