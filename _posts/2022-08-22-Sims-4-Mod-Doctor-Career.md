We bet most sims players will love this one! If you are looking for an immersive experience with a medical career, this mod is for you. You can choose from cardiology (which focuses on cardiac issues), pediatrics (which studies children and their development), plastic surgery (where surgeons operate on any part of the body if necessary), and dermatology (where doctors examine diseases of the skin).

Whether they want to be a professional comedian, famous social media influencer, or amateur street performer, it is up to them.

Jokes will be told at random when your sim is using the microphone in any venue. Feel free to download this one from this page.
It is the perfect choice for individuals interested in the medical field, but don’t want to go through the demands of becoming a doctor. Moreover, it is designed to be approachable and engaging, so it suits players of any age or skill level.

The Sims 4's Doctor Career comes via the Get to WorkExpansion Pack and is one of the most challenging Careers I've ever covered. In this Career, you will start with janitorial duties, interruption of actual Doctors with socials, and patient relations and proceed to being able to run your own tests and diagnose patients. As you go forward, the Career gets more defined although menial tasks will still pop up as objectives. You will eventually be able to perform surgeries and deliver Sim Babies as you advance, while your Sim will also have a clearer picture of what is wrong with the patient as they progress. The Doctor's Career level determines success rate with many interactions. Try to take care of patients as much as possible, and do not misdiagnose them, for fear of losing job performance! This guide should help you with those things, as I have a list of symptoms of each illness, while I'll also share the Doctor's career schedule and rewards.
