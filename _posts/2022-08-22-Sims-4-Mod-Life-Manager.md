## Create, manage and publish sims 4 mods.

Raxdiam’s The Sims 4 Mod Manager is simple to install, with a simplistic design making it easy to use. There are two things to note, this manager requires .NET Framework 4 or higher to work, and Raxdiam got their inspiration from Thrahistan, who created the first mod manager.

Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
The Sims 4 Mod Manager by GameTimeDev is incredibly easy to start using and works well alongside Sims 4 Studio. Even with the program being in its BETA phase, there is still plenty to come and will be a great addition for many players wanting to get on top of and keep their Mod folders organized!
You should never have to pay for any sims 4 mods ever, this includes custom content too. There are actually rules that come directly from EA that state that you are not allowed to have things behind permanent pay walls and are only allowed to have these items on early access on things like Patreon but you must eventually make these items available for free.
Next up we have the mega Sims 4 mod that is the MC Command Centre (opens in new tab). This control panel lets you tweak nearly every aspect of your Sims' lives throughout the neighbourhood, which basically means you’re a Sims 4 god. Set employment rates for various sim ages, find out who's pregnant, abort said babies if required, and even filter through settings for non-player controller Sims to make sure they're living their best lives. My favourite tweak is the time-based ones though, which make sure your Sim doesn't take hours upon hours to shower and eat breakfast before work every morning. If I can't do that Mortimer Goth, you can't either.

From here, just drop your downloaded mods straight into the folder /Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Normally any specific requirements for mod installation are listed on the page you download the mod from, but it's usually a very straightforward drag and drop job. One thing to remember is that if you download a zipped file, don't unzip it - simply just drag and drop the entire zipped file into your mods folder. Newer mods might have a .ts4script extension, and others might have a .package file, both of which you can just drag and drop.
Mods for the sims 4 include things like attending school with your children, having tragedies happen to your sims, and so much more. Below are 100+ mods that you can download for The Sims 4 that will change the game and are all really great options if you need to mix it up.
We know how sometimes it feels a bit frustrating when the career and job options in The Sims 4 are limited. Good thing tons of awesome job and career mods are easily available for download – thanks to the creative minds of mod creators! If you’re on the hunt for the best Sims 4 job and career mods, we’ve got some good news! This article puts together the best one we’ve found across several sources. Check them out below!
There are a number of questions we get every single time we write an article about sims 4 mods and pieces of custom content. It makes sense because there are so many questions and uncertainties when it comes to mods but we’re here to make those make sense!

## Manage your mods for best performance.

Note: If you have other mods and want to keep them organized, you can add one layer of the folder for the Mods folders. For example, you can create an MCCC folder within the Mods folder, but not another within the MCCC folder. If you do this, the mods will not be detected by the game.
Moving around the map can be a bit time-consuming and tedious, especially when trying to get a task done as soon as possible. Something that could help is a device that can teleport the player around. In the "Teleporter" mod, players will unlock the ability to make a teleporter once they reach tier five.
There are other features included in this mod manager. Those features are the ability to manage more than one library of mods at a time, automatic detection of different types of cc, multi-select to load/unload mods/cc, drag and drop, and view many styles for mod lists, and drag and drop.
You know that ultimate speed level that triggers when your Sims go to sleep or are all out of the house? Well, I know that sometimes it either doesn't trigger, or it's just not fast enough. So let's go faster with this SupeSpeed Mod (opens in new tab). No, that's not a typo, creator artum knows there's not even enough time sometimes to add the R to super. They get it. Once installed, you can trigger it when you hit the 3 key twice in quick succession. Begone long days and wasted time, begone!
The daily save mod by Tempest is totally game changing and will make it so you never lose your progress again! This mod allows you to choose a time of day (in the game) where your game will automatically save. You could make it so your game saves every morning at 8 am so you never miss a full day if your game or computer crashes again.
When you install MCCC for the first time, you will need to edit and save the Resource.cfg file. This is necessary the first time, but only once (even when you update the mod). You also only need to do this if you are not using specified sub-folders within your mods folder. If you are organizing with folders, you can skip this step.
On top of this, two super helpful elements that are being worked on for the mod are the Mini Water Extractor and the A.I. Fluid Packer. The water extractor can fit into small amounts of water and can greatly reduce power. The fluid packer is still being worked on but will simplify the packaging workflow.
There is also a drag and drop option in the form of a paperclip to the left of the window, which shows up if you have it full screen. The creator has plans for future updates, and you can even provide ideas and feedback and let them know any bugs you find.
