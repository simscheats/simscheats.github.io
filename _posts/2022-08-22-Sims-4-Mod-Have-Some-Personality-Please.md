The Sims 4 mods can truly improve your gaming experience. Although the game is fun enough on its own (there's plenty of stuff you can do in The Sims 4 already), it gets even better when you're able to have more meaningful conversations, or fix the lag that's been bothering you. We selected some of the handiest, most entertaining, and most beautiful Sims 4 mods out there. Check the list to see which ones you like best, and you can install them right away!
Sims 4 mods are often a labor of love from dedicated fans, putting their skills to use behind the scenes to add new abilities and create fresh experiences that otherwise wouldn't have made it into the game, which let's face it is already jam-packed with features! Sometimes these are made to resolve a particular issue that players regularly face, while others change the game completely by facilitating things such as realistic births, new traits, or living forever. Now there's such an extensive catalogue of add-ons available, it can feel a bit overwhelming try to determine which ones you'll benefit the most from, but whatever your needs are there should be something included here to help you on your way.
And there you have it, the best Sims 4 mods. This is just a small selection of what’s on offer: The level of detail that goes into these mods is extraordinary, and the thought behind them – like the wheelchair mod and gender transition potions mod – is heartwarming. While you’re here, why not check out our guide to the best management games, or perhaps you’d be interested in some strategy games instead?

The success of the game is driven by a thriving and lively bunch of modders who are responsible for creating tons of weird and wonderful additions to the game. If you’re looking for some excellent mods that will enhance your Sims 4 gaming experience, here are some great options you should consider.
Sims 4 has come a long way in improving certain aspects of the game that had long been forgotten by its predecessors. One of such features is the overhauled personality system. Despite the massive improvements, you will still find yourself wanting to make further improvements to the system. That is where this excellent mod comes in.
This is one of our favourites on the best Sims 4 mods list. It's a huge overhaul of—as you can probably guess—the way Sims’ personalities work. It changes lots in the background (read the description on the mod page for an exhaustive list) but the best thing about it is that it eliminates all idle conversations. Never again will two Sims blab aimlessly to each other about nothing in particular: instead, they’ll be forced to choose an interaction, which is far more interesting.
There's a mod called Wicked Whims that is pretty adult-themed but has a fair share of great tweaks that makes each sim in The Sims 4 all the more believable. Players who just want the family-friendly content present in this game should check out Wonderful Whims instead.

## Mod makers need to create new assets, write code, and more.

“Get a Job!” it’s a phrase you have heard all too often. With this mod, you can add a plethora of interesting and custom careers like a tattoo artist, stockbroker, game developer and so on. The developers are always adding new careers so getting yourself a new job is not going to be hard.
Once you're in game, you'll also need to enable mods in your game settings by going to your Options menu under the Other tab. Make sure to check off "Enable Custom Content and Mods" and "Script Mods Allowed" depending on what you've chosen to install. You'll need to restart your game afterwards.
Always check out the installation instructions for any mod you download just to be sure there aren't any more additional steps. Most should just be a quick matter of copying files over. Do keep an eye out for any dependencies your mods have, such as meshes creates by other modders that you'll also need to install.
ADD-ONs:
Since this mod is not a script mod, in-game option menus isn’t something I know how to create. So instead I have went with Addon’s. Any of these can be added to which over Flavor you choose! These also can be used alone with the main mod.Personality Please! Woohoo-TryForBaby
Even eight years in, new mods still pop up all the time on ModTheSims (opens in new tab)—which has long been the biggest platform for creators. You'll find everything from minor changes to total reworks. Some well-known modders, including LittleMsSam (opens in new tab) and KawaiiStacie (opens in new tab), have even become so big they have their own websites for their collections of creations.
I honestly don't know what these changes would look like or if it's even possible. But I am not opposed to developers trying. I don't want modders to feel that their creativity is being stifled or they are being shamed for their interests or fetishes. But some things are a bit beyond "expressing themselves" and are more in the harmful territory.
WIPThis mod is a work in process. What does that mean? Means more additions could be added at any time so check back often! For example: Pets. After that pack comes out I plan on playing around with it and maybe a new add-on will be created specifically for pets just like it was for our lively toddlers!
Just note the download page includes a lot of other mods from this creator, so look towards the lower part of the screen for their “Life’s Tragedies” download file. It does get updated from time-to-time so if you want the absolute newest version definitely grab it from the link above.
