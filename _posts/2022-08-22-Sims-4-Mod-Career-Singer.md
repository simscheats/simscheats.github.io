## Create a singing career in the sims 4.

The Sims 4 has a singing career that allows you to make a living while as a singer/songwriter. It’s a great career for any musical and artistic Sim that aspires to be a star. There are many levels that you can progress through and advance, so it’s an exciting career path to pursue. But one of the biggest problems that simmers have is they don’t know how to write songs in Sims 4.

Writing songs unlocks at level 8 and licensing them is level 9. Singing is another way to earn money from music in The Sims 4, and in combination with the other instruments is viable as a self-employment career. However, it is one that requires substantially more work due to the effort required to master the instruments.
If you want to write songs in Sims 4, your Sim must own an instrument and be at least level 8 skill in that instrument. If you meet these requirements, all you need to do is click on the instrument and select “Write Song”. It can take up to 12 sim hours to write a song in Sims 4.
Once the Sims aren't any longer hopelessly bad at singing and reach level eight of this skill, they can take their singing to another step and make a career out of it. This is because level eight unlocks the possibility to write their own lyrics. They can do so by clicking on a microphone, a piano, or a guitar. But as said above, the Sim has to be able to play any of the two musical instruments at least at level three.
The Sims 4 City Living features a singing skill, which lets Sims gradually improve their vocal range. This skill must have taken some work, as Sims grow to sing much better over time and eventually sing near-perfectly. With higher levels in singing, you can begin to write songs and even license them to earn some extra money. This skill synergizes with both the Piano and Guitar skills. Getting to level 3 in those two instruments, your Sim will be able to sing and play at the same time. It's not an enjoyable listen at first, but they get much, much better with practice.

Updated February 12, 2022, by Jamie Pellikaan: With the inclusion of Sims: Discover University and other massive expansion packs, there are even more ways to pursue your Sims’ dream of becoming a music icon. Whether you want to be a celebrity, or simply enchant your friends at a Karaoke bar, there are several ways to be a successful signer and launch a successful career in the field. From the moment you create a Sim, be confident that they will literally rock the entire musical field. ​​​​​​​
The Sims 4 has a lot to offer. One of these things is many careers the Sims can decide to join. One of them is the singing career, ideal for all the creative types out there. And while it's not an easy task to join this career and be successful at it, there are some tips that will help the players and the Sims fulfill their aspirations.
Things like singing to an audience, promoting brands, and being an idol other Sims look up to is something the sims 4 community needs! So, whoever you are, a new or a veteran simmer, please go and try the Road To Fame mod. You will thank us later! Happy Simming!
Unsurprisingly, the higher the skill the Sims has, the higher the possibility they will become famous. Singing and playing a musical instrument are no exception. Sims can accompany their singing by playing a musical instrument once they reach level three in piano or guitar skills. They should practice often to get their skills to the highest level possible. Or, for the players who don't want to put the time in, there's always a cheat that will boost the Sim's skills to level ten.

## Become a famous sims 4 career singer.

But that’s not all! As you progress in your singing career, you will quickly notice the day-to-day changes. Your Sim will become a really popular figure in the community, so expect a lot of paparazzi or questionable comments on the simstagram! The Professional Singing skill will be your indicator of how deep in the celebrity you are. So if you want a historic glory out of your singing, then make sure to practice and practice all day long!
Any Sim can show off their talent with the expansion pack Get Famous. So, let your Sim flaunt their voice and get the eye, and ears, of Sims who have already reached celebrity status. Doing so can raise your fame and the success of your signing career.
A lot of people want to be famous, and the Sims are no different! In The Sims 4, everyone has a chance to achieve stardom with the Get Famous expansion. Sims can become famous in multiple areas, such as acting, writing, painting, music, or politics. They can even simply be a social media influencer, their world's equivalent of an Instagram or YouTube star.
I have to say that I played this family a lot, getting my would-be singing star ready. (I was going to try to make a singer out of him on my own using only the MCCC mod to 'pay' him. I got him up to a teen (had him born in game). He's a musical genius. His voice at level 10 as is his charisma. Suffice it to say he's got a lot going for him. I deleted the previous RTF mod I had when it was announced we were getting GF, thinking I wouldn't need it. Then learned, after my teen was working his way toward his second star, that there was this latest RTF option. Suffice it to say he's doing very well. He earns 10,000 Simoleons per concert, and he's done so many magazine shoots, he's at the top of the modeling career, which now means he also earns 10,000 Simoleons per session. Royalties are at 200 per song, and he has recorded 51.
Introverted Sims might not be so happy about this step, but one way to increase fame is to just go out, interact with the public, and show off some talent. Sims who want to be famous singers, for example, should visit open mics at clubs and bars to showcase their skills.
Graham just confirmed that if you have city living that you can become famous for being a singer. More crowds of sims will show up around you the better your skill and fame, and you get better tips. Singing karaoke on mic night is a great way to help boost awareness.
One skill that the wannabe famous Sims should level up that players often forget about, though, is charisma. If a Sim with a high level of charisma posts a story on Simstagram, they will get more followers (and more fame) than Sims with a lower level of the skill.
Yeah, it’s really interesting because I had both her and another sim practice their respective contest songs. She scored a 71 (lmao) while very inspired, and the other sims (who’s L9), scored a 100 w/ the same mood. Idk, I wish the developers released more info on how these contests exactly are factored. (Also, I know it is a mere 500 simoleon prize, but it’s nice to know your sims are the ruling couple at the karaoke bar lol)
