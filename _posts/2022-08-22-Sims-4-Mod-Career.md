## Create your own sims 4 mod career.

This job fills up your career panel, and now your sim is self-employed, and you can give him as many tasks as you want or run the business with more official status. This mod was created for role-playing, but we can see a lot of areas you can use it in The Sims 4.

A new mod has been created for the game The Sims 4 that will allow your sim to have their own Youtube channel. Your sim can upload videos of themselves playing games, DIY or makeup tutorials, and more. They can also update their channel with blog posts, vlogs, and live streams to keep up their gamer, DIY, or MUA cred on top of having a full-time job. Another cool thing about this mod is that it will let your sim go vlogging and make videos of their everyday life. To take your Sim down this career path, know that they will struggle. So, you need to have some patience. Check it out on this page.
Next up on our list of sims 4 career mods is the Filmmaker Career where your sims will get to discover a life where they get to create their own movies. The interesting thing about this career is that the first stage has your sims as a “film student” where they’re working from 4pm to 10pm every weekday but they are only earning a sad 3 simoleons per hour.
The next option on our list of sims 4 career mods is the Orthotist and Prosthetist medical career. This is a one level career for your storytelling so you can give it to sims and just have them work this job for life. This is nice because you don’t have to work toward promotions and can just get your money and go home.
The Sims 4 has given a new dimension to its gameplay. The introduction of the career mod has not only enabled players to pursue their desired careers and live their dreams but also make the gameplay more realistic. Inspired by real-life comedians, the comedian career mod allows players to make their sims the next big thing in comedy. Whether they want to be a professional comedian, famous social media influencer, or amateur street performer, it is up to them. It is often assumed that being a comedian is one of the hardest jobs out there because they need confidence, wit, and comedy skills on top of being talented at making people laugh. Jokes will be told at random when your sim is using the microphone in any venue. Feel free to download this one from this page.

The thing I love about downloading sims 4 career mods is that sometimes they cover careers that will never be in the game proper. A career like wind turbine technician is so random and EA would most likely never add this to their game because it isn’t popular or mainstream. These sims work forty hours a week and earn over 50 simoleons a week so it’s fun!
The next option on our list of sims 4 career mods is the data scientist career. These sims are going to be working with a ton of information that they are responsible for organizing and using it to make their company more money. They’ll need to understands the basics of the programming skill and will have to have a keen eye for numbers and information.
