## Build a harem in sims 4.

To get a boyfriend or girlfriend in the Sims 4, start by sending your sim to a social location, so they can meet other sims. Once you find another sim, have your sim introduce themselves, so they start talking. During the conversation, look for positive green plus signs over the sims' heads to see if they're getting along. Once you've built a friendship between two sims, click the "Romance" option and choose "Flirt." If both sims respond positively to the flirting, continue choosing "Romance" conversation options until the "Romance" bar reaches at least 30 percent. From here, you should be able to select "Ask to Be Boyfriend" or "Ask to Be Girlfriend" from the "Romance" menu. If your sim gets rejected, try again when your "Romance" bar reaches 50 percent.
