One of the most important Sims 4 cheat codes to enter is testingcheats true, which enables additional cheats and allows you to shift-click on Sims, items etc to reveal further cheat options. To shift-click on consoles, press X+O (PS4) or A+B (XBO) at the same time.

The UI cheats extension mod is undoubtedly the only tool you will ever need for your Sims 4 game because it allows you to control and fulfil your sims' needs by accessing them directly from the menu. As there are several needs for sims in the game, it is tough to memorize several syntaxes.
Cheats are by no means new to The Sims, but if you’ve never played past entries in this beloved life game series or worry that the cheats of previous Sims games won’t work here, then allow us to step in with a dedicated list of Sims 4 cheats. We’ll walk you through how to enter Sims 4 cheats, give you a list of the very best cheats to use, and explain exactly what each one offers you.
By default, cheat usage is disabled when you first launch your game. To enable cheats in The Sims 4 for PC, you must press SHIFT + CTRL + C on your keyboard. This combination of keys will trigger the cheat console, or the cheat box as we call it, to pop up. That’s the little window that appears in the upper left corner of your screen. We use it to type in our codes whenever we want to activate on.

## Sims 4 mod all cheats for mac.

If you’re playing The Sims 4 on Windows or Mac, you can customize the game using custom content (CC) and mods. Installing them can be complicated if you’re new to modding games, but The Sims 4 makes it fairly easy. Our The Sims 4 guide will walk you through how to install CC and mods for both Windows and Mac. (You cannot install or use mods and CC on consoles.)
The UI cheats extension mod is completely compatible with Mac computers and can be downloaded and installed in a similar way as you did for other PCs. All you need to do is follow the set of instructions given above, and you will have this extension mod installed in your game in no time.
Enabling cheats on Mac, PS4 and Xbox 1 is pretty much the same thing. The only difference is, in order to trigger the cheat console, you need to press a different key combination. Follow the instructions below to open up the cheat box on each of the four gaming platforms:
Now, The Sims 4 Jungle Adventure cheats are another story. First of all, in Jungle Adventure there are two new skills that your Sim can have. Second, while playing Jungle Adventure, you can help your Sim by giving them some of the appropriate traits. And lastly, there are many more codes similar to this one, so make sure to try them out! Pretty useful stuff!
There are a few differences between entering cheat codes on a PC/Mac and entering them on a console like the PlayStation®4 or Xbox One. The most important, though, is that enabling some cheats on a console actually disables Achievements and Trophies on your current game save. You’ll need to earn those the old-fashioned way, without using cheats.
The first mod on our list is MC Command Center and it has been around for years and lets you cheat so many things in the game, with some of my favorites being the pregnancy cheats. To use MC Command Center you can click on sims, or the mailbox and there will be a new box to click that says MC Command Center and when you click this you’ll be given tons of options.
Many players who enjoy this game on a Mac usually believe that it is not compatible with their operating system and works only with the Windows OS. However, it is a fairly common misconception that revolves around the community and needs to be shattered.
While this mod is activated, left-clicking on your money will automatically add a thousand simoleons to your account. This can prove to be very helpful when you require extra money to purchase your desired in-game items. This same step can be replicated infinite times to gain a pile of cash without any effort.
